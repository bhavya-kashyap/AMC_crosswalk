Understanding their evolution and function is limited by an inability to isolate genomes in a high-throughput manner. Here, we present a workflow for bacterial whole-genome sequencing using open-source labware and the OpenTrons robotics platform, reducing costs to approximately $10 per genome. We assess genomic diversity within 45 gut bacterial species from wild-living chimpanzees and bonobos. We quantify intraspecific genomic diversity and reveal divergence of homologous plasmids between hosts. This enables population genetic analyses of bacterial strains not currently possible with metagenomic data alone.",OCT 12,2022,23,1,,,212,10.1186/s13059-022-02777-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-022-02777-w,,36224660,WOS:000866497500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, using data from a genome-wide association study of 5.4 million individuals of diverse ancestries, we show that 12,111 independent SNPs that are significantly associated with height account for nearly all of the common SNP-based heritability. These SNPs are clustered within 7,209 non-overlapping genomic segments with a mean size of around 90 kb, covering about 21% of the genome. The density of independent associations varies across the genome and the regions of increased density are enriched for biologically relevant genes. In out-of-sample estimation and prediction, the 12,111 SNPs (or all SNPs in the HapMap 3 panel(2)) account for 40% (45%) of phenotypic variance in populations of European ancestry but only around 10-20% (14-24%) in populations of other ancestries. Effect sizes, associated regions and gene prioritization are similar across ancestries, indicating that reduced prediction accuracy is likely to be explained by linkage disequilibrium and differences in allele frequency within associated regions. Finally, we show that the relevant biological pathways are detectable with smaller sample sizes than are needed to implicate causal genes and variants. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive map of specific genomic regions that contain the vast majority of common height-associated variants. Although this map is saturated for populations of European ancestry, further research is needed to achieve equivalent saturation in other ancestries. A large genome-wide association study of more than 5 million individuals reveals that 12,111 single-nucleotide polymorphisms account for nearly all the heritability of height attributable to common genetic variants.",,,,,,,,10.1038/s41586-022-05275-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05275-y,OCT 2022,36224396,WOS:000866362700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Evaluation Design This retrospective design first compared EVP patients considered engaged or not engaged in completing treatment in terms of demographic characteristics and post-treatment changes in clinical measures related to opioid use and mental health. We then compared mortality risk between matched groups of treated and untreated patients with chronic pain and concurrent opioid prescriptions using propensity score matching and Cox proportional hazards methods. Treated in the matched groups was defined as any level of EVP participation (i.e., both engaged and not engaged). Data Collection/Extraction Methods We first identified 1053 EVP patients with 1 year of pre-and post-treatment follow-time and determined their engagement level. From those with chronic pain and prescription opioids, we matched 237 EVP patients to 375 untreated patients. Principal Findings Engaged patients (57.4% of treated patients), were somewhat older than the non-engaged (mean age 57.1 vs. 53.7, Cohen's D = 0.30), and achieved lower mean PHQ9 depression scores in the post-treatment year (9.2 vs. 10.6, Cohen's D = 0.20). Participation in EVP was associated with a 65% lower mortality risk among Veterans with chronic pain and opioid use when compared to the untreated patients: (HR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.17, 0.75). Conclusions EVP was associated with a large reduction in mortality risk for Veterans with both chronic pain and opioid use. This result could inform the decision process in a VA station or region when considering providing or expanding access to an interdisciplinary rehabilitation/functional restoration program for chronic pain.",,,,,,,,10.1111/1475-6773.14062,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1475-6773.14062,OCT 2022,36064854,WOS:000865547600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To explore this homology, we performed a genome-wide comparison between human and mimivirus using DELTA-BLAST (Domain Enhanced Lookup Time Accelerated BLAST) and identified 52 new putative mimiviral proteins that are homologous with human proteins. To gain functional insights into mimiviral proteins, their human protein homologs were organized into Gene Ontology (GO) and REACTOME pathways to build a functional network. Collagen and collagen-modifying enzymes form the largest subnetwork with most nodes. Further analysis of this subnetwork identified a putative collagen glycosyltransferase R699. Protein expression test suggested that R699 is highly expressed in Escherichia coli, unlike the human collagen-modifying enzymes. Enzymatic activity assay and mass spectrometric analyses showed that R699 catalyzes the glucosylation of galactosylhydroxylysine to glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine on collagen using uridine diphosphate glucose (UDP-glucose) but no other UDP-sugars as a sugar donor, suggesting R699 is a mimiviral collagen galactosylhydroxylysyl glucosyltransferase (GGT). To facilitate further analysis of human and mimiviral homologous proteins, we presented an interactive and searchable genome-wide comparison website for quickly browsing human and Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus homologs, which is available at RRID Resource ID: SCR_022140 or https://guolab.shinyapps.io/app-mimivirus-publication/.",OCT 7,2022,12,1,,,16806,10.1038/s41598-022-21197-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-21197-1,,36207453,WOS:000865124900024,View Full Record in Web of Science

The large NH termini characteristic of AGPCRs confer unique properties to each receptor and possess a variety of distinct domains that can 2 bind to a diverse array of extracellular proteins and components of the extracellular matrix. The traditional view of AGPCRs, as implied by their name, is that their core function is the mediation of adhesion. In recent years, though, many surprising advances have been made regarding AGPCR signaling mechanisms, activation by mechanosensory forces, and stimulation by small-molecule ligands such as steroid hormones and bioactive lipids. Thus, a new view of AGPCRs has begun to emerge in which these receptors are seen as massive signaling platforms that are crucial for the integration of adhesive, mechanosensory, and chemical stimuli. This review article describes the recent advances that have led to this new understanding of AGPCR function and also discusses new insights into the physiological actions of these receptors as well as their roles in human disease.",OCT,2022,102,4,1587,1624,,10.1152/physrev.00027.2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/physrev.00027.2021,,35468004,WOS:000861655000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, in cross-ancestry GWAS meta-analyses of 110,182 patients who have had a stroke (five ancestries, 33% non-European) and 1,503,898 control individuals, we identify association signals for stroke and its subtypes at 89 (61 new) independent loci: 60 in primary inverse-variance-weighted analyses and 29 in secondary meta-regression and multitrait analyses. On the basis of internal cross-ancestry validation and an independent follow-up in 89,084 additional cases of stroke (30% non-European) and 1,013,843 control individuals, 87% of the primary stroke risk loci and 60% of the secondary stroke risk loci were replicated (P < 0.05). Effect sizes were highly correlated across ancestries. Cross-ancestry fine-mapping, in silico mutagenesis analysis(3), and transcriptome-wide and proteome-wide association analyses revealed putative causal genes (such as SH3PXD2A and FURIN) and variants (such as at GRK5 and NOS3). Using a three-pronged approach(4), we provide genetic evidence for putative drug effects, highlighting F11, KLKB1, PROC, GP1BA, LAMC2 and VCAM1 as possible targets, with drugs already under investigation for stroke for F11 and PROC. A polygenic score integrating cross-ancestry and ancestry-specific stroke GWASs with vascular-risk factor GWASs (integrative polygenic scores) strongly predicted ischaemic stroke in populations of European, East Asian and African ancestry(5). Stroke genetic risk scores were predictive of ischaemic stroke independent of clinical risk factors in 52,600 clinical-trial participants with cardiometabolic disease. Our results provide insights to inform biology, reveal potential drug targets and derive genetic risk prediction tools across ancestries.",,,,,,,,10.1038/s41586-022-05165-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05165-3,SEP 2022,36180795,WOS:000862209300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A robust literature has evolved around examining the role of these scope of practice laws in various contexts, including labor market outcomes, health care access, health care prices, and the delivery of care for specific diseases. Unfortunately, these studies use different, and sometimes conflicting, measures of scope of practice laws, limiting their comparability and overall usefulness to policymakers and future researchers. We address this salient problem by providing a recommended coding of nurse practitioner scope of practice laws over a 24-year period based on actual statutory and regulatory language. Our classification of scope of practice laws solves an important problem within this growing literature and provides a solid legal foundation for researchers as they continue to investigate the effects of these laws.",,,,,,,,10.1177/10775587221126777,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10775587221126777,SEP 2022,36172783,WOS:000861553700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although recognition of pathogen-specific moieties or PAMPs by specialized receptors of the immune system is well defined for a great number of pathogens, the mechanisms of sensing of pathogen-induced functional perturbations to the host cell remain poorly understood. Here we show that the disruption of endosomal compartments in macrophages by a bacterium or fully synthetic nanoparticles activates stress-response p38MAPK kinase, which triggers execution of cell death of a necrotic type. p38MAPK-mediated necrosis occurs in cells with a compound homozygous deletion of pyroptosis-inducing caspases-1 and -11, apoptotic caspase-8, and necroptosis-inducing receptor-interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK3), indicating that all of these principal cell death mediators are dispensable for p38MAPK-induced necrosis in response to endosome rupture. p38MAPK-mediated necrosis is suppressed by the receptor-interacting protein kinase 1, RIPK1, and degradation of RIPK1 sensitizes macrophages to necrotic death. Since pathogen-induced cell death of necrotic types is implicated in host defense against infection, our results indicate that functional perturbations in host cells are sensed as a component of the innate immune system.",SEP 29,2022,12,1,,,16357,10.1038/s41598-022-20786-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-20786-4,,36175595,WOS:000862059200019,View Full Record in Web of Science

Hashimoto et al. have shown that, in chronic infections, administration of the cytokine interleukin (IL)-2 triggers an alternative differentiation path of stem-like T cells towards a distinct population of 'better effector' CD8(+) T cells similar to those generated in an acute infection(5). IL-2 binding to the IL-2 receptor alpha-chain (CD25) was essential in triggering this alternative differentiation path and expanding better effectors with distinct transcriptional and epigenetic profiles. However, constitutive expression of CD25 on regulatory T cells and some endothelial cells also contributes to unwanted systemic effects from IL-2 therapy. Therefore, engineered IL-2 receptor beta- and gamma-chain (IL-2R beta gamma)-biased agonists are currently being developed(6-10). Here we show that IL-2R beta gamma-biased agonists are unable to preferentially expand better effector T cells in cancer models and describe PD1-IL2v, a new immunocytokine that overcomes the need for CD25 binding by docking in cis to PD-1. Cis binding of PD1-IL2v to PD-1 and IL-2R beta gamma on the same cell recovers the ability to differentiate stem-like CD8(+) T cells into better effectors in the absence of CD25 binding in both chronic infection and cancer models and provides superior efficacy. By contrast, PD-1- or PD-L1-blocking antibodies alone, or their combination with clinically relevant doses of non-PD-1-targeted IL2v, cannot expand this unique subset of better effector T cells and instead lead to the accumulation of terminally differentiated, exhausted T cells. These findings provide the basis for the development of a new generation of PD-1 cis-targeted IL-2R agonists with enhanced therapeutic potential for the treatment of cancer and chronic infections.",,,,,,,,10.1038/s41586-022-05192-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05192-0,SEP 2022,36171284,WOS:000861426000010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we examine the underlying basis for this synergy. We show that PD-1 + IL-2 combination therapy, in contrast to PD-1 monotherapy, substantially changes the differentiation program of the PD-1(+)TCF1(+) stem-like CD8(+) T cells and results in the generation of transcriptionally and epigenetically distinct effector CD8(+) T cells that resemble highly functional effector CD8(+) T cells seen after an acute viral infection. The generation of these qualitatively superior CD8(+) T cells that mediate viral control underlies the synergy between PD-1 and IL-2. Our results show that the PD-1(+)TCF1(+) stem-like CD8(+) T cells, also referred to as precursors of exhausted CD8(+) T cells, are not fate-locked into the exhaustion program and their differentiation trajectory can be changed by IL-2 signals. These virus-specific effector CD8(+) T cells emerging from the stem-like CD8(+) T cells after combination therapy expressed increased levels of the high-affinity IL-2 trimeric (CD25-CD122-CD132) receptor. This was not seen after PD-1 blockade alone. Finally, we show that CD25 engagement with IL-2 has an important role in the observed synergy between IL-2 cytokine and PD-1 blockade. Either blocking CD25 with an antibody or using a mutated version of IL-2 that does not bind to CD25 but still binds to CD122 and CD132 almost completely abrogated the synergistic effects observed after PD-1 + IL-2 combination therapy. There is considerable interest in PD-1 + IL-2 combination therapy for patients with cancer(2,3), and our fundamental studies defining the underlying mechanisms of how IL-2 synergizes with PD-1 blockade should inform these human translational studies.",,,,,,,,10.1038/s41586-022-05257-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05257-0,SEP 2022,36171288,WOS:000861426000004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The primary end point was the change from baseline to week 28 in the total score on the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R; range, 0 to 48, with higher scores indicating better function) among participants predicted to have faster-progressing disease. Secondary end points included changes in the total concentration of SOD1 protein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), in the concentration of neurofilament light chains in plasma, in slow vital capacity, and in handheld dynamometry in 16 muscles. A combined analysis of the randomized component of the trial and its open-label extension at 52 weeks compared the results in participants who started tofersen at trial entry (early-start cohort) with those in participants who switched from placebo to the drug at week 28 (delayed-start cohort).ResultsA total of 72 participants received tofersen (39 predicted to have faster progression), and 36 received placebo (21 predicted to have faster progression). Tofersen led to greater reductions in concentrations of SOD1 in CSF and of neurofilament light chains in plasma than placebo. In the faster-progression subgroup (primary analysis), the change to week 28 in the ALSFRS-R score was -6.98 with tofersen and -8.14 with placebo (difference, 1.2 points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -3.2 to 5.5; P=0.97). Results for secondary clinical end points did not differ significantly between the two groups. A total of 95 participants (88%) entered the open-label extension. At 52 weeks, the change in the ALSFRS-R score was -6.0 in the early-start cohort and -9.5 in the delayed-start cohort (difference, 3.5 points; 95% CI, 0.4 to 6.7); non-multiplicity-adjusted differences favoring early-start tofersen were seen for other end points. Lumbar puncture-related adverse events were common. Neurologic serious adverse events occurred in 7% of tofersen recipients.ConclusionsIn persons with SOD1 ALS, tofersen reduced concentrations of SOD1 in CSF and of neurofilament light chains in plasma over 28 weeks but did not improve clinical end points and was associated with adverse events.

Mutations that activate Sonic hedgehog signalling lead to Sonic hedgehog MB in the upper rhombic lip (RL) granule cell lineage(5-8). By contrast, mutationsthat activate WNT signalling lead to WNT MB in the lower RL9,10. However, little is known about the more commonly occurringgroup 4 (G4) MB, which isthought to arise in the unipolar brush cell lineage(3,4). Here we demonstrate that somatic mutationsthat cause G4 MB converge on the core binding factor alpha (CBFA) complex and mutually exclusive alterations that affect CBFA2T2, CBFA2T3, PRDM6, UTX and OTX2. CBFA2T2 is expressed early in the progenitor cells ofthe cerebellar RL subventricular zone in Homo sapiens, and G4 MB transcriptionally resembles these progenitors but are stalled in developmental time. Knockdown of OTX2in model systems relieves this differentiation blockade, which allows MB cellsto spontaneously proceed along normal developmental differentiation trajectories.

Single-cell transcriptional profiling showed that both light- and dark-zone germinal centre states were sustained. Antibody somatic hypermutation of B-GC cells continued to accumulate throughout the 29-week priming period, with evidence of selective pressure. Env-binding B-GC cells were still 49-fold above baseline at 29 weeks, which suggests that they could remain active for even longer periods of time. High titres of HIV-neutralizing antibodies were generated after a single booster immunization. Fully glycosylated HIV trimer protein is a complex antigen, posing considerable immunodominance challenges for B cells(1,2). Memory B cells generated under these long priming conditions had higher levels of antibody somatic hypermutation, and both memory B cells and antibodies were more likely to recognize non-immunodominant epitopes. Numerous B-GC cell lineage phylogenies spanning more than the 6-month germinal centre period were identified, demonstrating continuous germinal centre activity and selection for at least 191 days with no further antigen exposure. A long-prime, slow-delivery (12 days) immunization approach holds promise for difficult vaccine targets and suggests that patience can have great value for tuning of germinal centres to maximize antibody responses.",SEP 29,2022,609,7929,998,+,,10.1038/s41586-022-05216-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05216-9,SEP 2022,36131022,WOS:000858380500008,View Full Record in Web of Science

RECOMMENDATIONS Candidates for a regimen with a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor and hormonal therapy should undergo testing for PIK3CA mutations using next-generation sequencing of tumor tissue or circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in plasma to determine eligibility for alpelisib plus fulvestrant. If no mutation is found in ctD NA, testing in tumor tissue, if available, should be used. Patients who are candidates for poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor therapy should undergo testing for germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations to determine eligibility for a PARP inhibitor. There is insufficient evidence for or against testing for a germline PALB2 pathogenic variant to determine eligibility for PARP inhibitor therapy in the metastatic setting. Candidates for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy should undergo testing for expression of programmed cell death ligand-1 in the tumor and immune cells to determine eligibility for treatment with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy. Candidates for an immune checkpoint inhibitor should also undergo testing for deficient mismatch repair/microsatellite instability-high to determine eligibility for dostarlimab-gxly or pembrolizumab, as well as testing for tumor mutational burden. Clinicians may test for NTRKfusions to determine eligibility for TR K inhibitors. There are insufficient data to recommend routine testing of tumors for ESR1 mutations, for homologous recombination deficiency, or for TROP2 expression to guide MBC therapy selection.

The initial report, typically based on the primary end point, may be published when key planned coprimary or secondary analyses are not yet available. Clinical Trial Updates provide an opportunity to disseminate additional results from studies, published in JCO or elsewhere, for which the primary end point has already been reported. The purpose of this update was to determine differences in patient-reported chronic toxicity and disease outcomes with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) compared with conventional pelvic radiation. Patients with cervical and endometrial cancers who received postoperative pelvic radiation were randomly assigned to conventional radiation therapy (CRT) or IMRT. Toxicity and quality of life were assessed using Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) bowel and urinary domains, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General. Between 2012 and 2015, 279 eligible patients were enrolled to the study with a median follow-up of 37.8 months. There were no differences in overall survival (P = .53), disease-free survival (P = .21), or locoregional failure (P = .81). One year after RT, patients in the CRT arm experienced more high-level diarrhea frequency (5.8% IMRT v 15.1% CRT, P = .042) and a greater number had to take antidiarrheal medication two or more times a day (1.2% IMRT v 8.6% CRT, P = .036). At 3 years, women in the CRT arm reported a decline in urinary function, whereas the IMRT arm continued to improve (mean change in EPIC urinary score = 0.5, standard deviation = 13.0, IMRT v -6.0, standard deviation = 14.3, CRT, P = .005).

Several brain regions underlying fear learning and expression have previously been associated with PTSD, with the hippocampus, amygdala, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), and rostral ACC (rACC) showing altered volume and function in those with PTSD. However, few studies have examined how sex impacts the predictive value of subcortical volumes and cortical thickness in longitudinal PTSD studies. As part of an emergency department study completed at the Grady Trauma Project in Atlanta, GA, N = 93 (40 Female) participants were enrolled within 24 h following a traumatic event. Multi-echo T1-weighted MRI images were collected one-month post-trauma exposure. Bilateral amygdala and hippocampal volumes and rACC and dACC cortical thickness were segmented. To assess the longitudinal course of PTSD, the PTSD Symptom Scale (PSS) was collected 6 months post-trauma. We investigated whether regional volume/thickness interacted with sex to predict later PTSD symptom severity, controlling for PSS score at time of scan, age, race, and trauma type, as well as intracranial volume (ICV) for subcortical volumes. There was a significant interaction between sex and rACC for 6-month PSS, such that right rACC thickness was positively correlated with 6-month PSS scores in females, but not in males. In examining PTSD symptom subtypes and depression symptoms, greater rACC thickness in females predicted greater avoidance symptoms, while smaller rACC thickness in males predicted greater depression symptoms. Amygdala and hippocampus volume and dACC thickness showed no main effect or interaction with sex. The current findings provide evidence for sex-based differences in how brain volume predicts future PTSD severity and symptoms and supports the rACC as being a vital region regarding PTSD. Gender differences should be assessed in future longitudinal PTSD MRI studies for more accurate identification of future PTSD risk following trauma.",,,,,,,,10.1038/s41386-022-01452-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41386-022-01452-9,SEP 2022,36114284,WOS:000854413900003,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the present study, we examined associations of RD with cingulate, hippocampus and amygdala gray matter morphology in a sample of trauma-exposed Black women. Eighty-one Black women aged 19-62 years were recruited as part of an ongoing study of trauma. Participants completed assessments of RD, trauma exposure, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and underwent T1-weighted anatomical imaging. Cortical thickness, surface area and gray matter volume were extracted from subregions of cingulate cortex, and gray matter volume was extracted from amygdala and hippocampus, and entered into partial correlation analyses that included RD and other socio-environmental variables. After correction for multiple comparisons and accounting for variance associated with other stressors and socio-environmental factors, participants with more RD exposure showed proportionally lower cortical thickness in the left rACC, caudal ACC, and posterior cingulate cortex (ps < = 0.01). These findings suggest that greater experiences of RD are linked to compromised cingulate gray matter thickness. In the context of earlier findings indicating that RD produces increased response in threat neurocircuitry, our data suggest that RD may increase vulnerability for brain health problems via cingulate cortex alterations.

We investigated vaccine-induced antibody responses in patients with NHL/CLL against the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and variants of concern including B.1.167.2 (Delta) and B.1.1.529 (Omicron). MATERIALS AND METHODS Blood from 121 patients with NHL/CLL receiving two doses of vaccine were collected longitudinally. Antibody binding against the full-length spike protein, the receptor-binding, and N-terminal domains of the original strain and of variants was measured using a multiplex assay. Live-virus neutralization against Delta, Omicron, and the early WA1/2020 strains was measured using a focus reduction neutralization test. B cells were measured by flow cytometry. Correlation between vaccine response and clinical factors was determined. RESULTS Mean anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike immunoglobulin G-binding titers were 85-fold lower in patients with NHL/CLL compared with healthy controls, with seroconversion occurring in only 67% of patients. Neutralization titers were also lower and correlated with binding titers (P < .0001). Treatment with anti-CD20-directed therapies within 1 year resulted in 136-fold lower binding titers. Peripheral blood B-cell count also correlated with vaccine response. At 3 months from last anti-CD20-directed therapy, B-cell count >= 4.31/mu L blood around the time of vaccination predicted response (OR 7.46, P = .04). Antibody responses also correlated with age. Importantly, neutralization titers against Delta and Omicron were reduced six- and 42-fold, respectively, with 67% of patients seropositive for WA1/2020 exhibiting seronegativity for Omicron. CONCLUSION Antibody binding and live-virus neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants of concern including Delta and Omicron were substantially lower in patients with NHL/CLL compared with healthy vaccinees.

Patients with B-cell malignancies including myeloma are at increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality and exhibit variable serologic response to the vaccine. The capacity of vaccine-induced antibodies in these patients to neutralize SARS CoV-2 or its variants is not known. METHODS Sera from 238 patients with multiple myeloma (MM) undergoing SARS CoV-2 vaccination were analyzed. Antibodies against the SARS CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and viral nucleocapsid were measured to detect serologic response to vaccine and environmental exposure to the virus. The capacity of antibodies to neutralize virus was quantified using pseudovirus neutralization assay and live virus neutralization against the initial SARS CoV-2 strain and the B1.617.2 (Delta) variant. RESULTS Vaccine-induced nAbs are detectable at much lower rates (54%) than estimated in previous seroconversion studies in MM, which did not monitor viral neutralization. In 33% of patients, vaccine-induced antispike RBD antibodies lack detectable neutralizing capacity, including against the B1.617.2 variant. Induction of nAbs is affected by race, disease, and treatment-related factors. Patients receiving mRNA1273 vaccine (Moderna) achieved significantly greater induction of nAbs compared with those receiving BNT162b2 (Pfizer; 67% v 48%, P = .006). CONCLUSION These data show that vaccine-induced antibodies in several patients with MM lack detectable virus-neutralizing activity. Vaccine-mediated induction of nAbs is affected by race, disease, vaccine, and treatment characteristics.

Equitable offering of such information is a professional and ethical obligation and an opportunity to prevent racial disparities in maternal and child health. Data Source: Primary data from patients at southern United States publicly funded family planning clinics, October 2018-June 2019. Study Design: Patients at 14 clinics completed a survey about their experiences with pregnancy options counseling and referral following a positive pregnancy test. The primary predictor variable was patients' self-reported racial identity. Outcomes included discussion of pregnancy options, referral for those options, and for support services. Data Collection: Data from eligible patients with non-missing information for key variables (n = 313) were analyzed using descriptive statistics, chi(2) tests, and multivariable logistic regression. Principal Findings: Patients were largely Black (58%), uninsured (64%), and 18-29 years of age (80%). Intention to continue pregnancy and receipt of prenatal care referral did not differ significantly among Black as compared to non-Black patients. However, Black patients had a higher likelihood of wanting an abortion or adoption referral and not receiving one (abortion: marginal effect [ME] = 7.68%, p = 0.037; adjusted ME [aME] = 9.02%, p = 0.015; adoption: ME = 7.06%, p = 0.031; aME = 8.42%, p = 0.011). Black patients intending to end their pregnancies had a lower probability of receiving an abortion referral than non-Black patients (ME = -22.37%, p = 0.004; aME = -19.69%, p = 0.023). In the fully adjusted model, Black patients also had a higher probability of wanting access to care resources (including transportation, childcare, and financial support) and not receiving them (aME = 5.38%, p = 0.019). Conclusions: Clinical interactions surrounding pregnancy confirmation provide critical opportunities to discuss options, coordinate care, and mitigate risk, yet are susceptible to systemic bias. These findings add to limited evidence around pregnancy counseling and referral disparities. Ongoing assessment of pregnancy counseling and referral disparities can provide insight into organizational strengths or the potential to increase structural equity.",,,,,,,,10.1111/1475-6773.14049,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1475-6773.14049,SEP 2022,36068681,WOS:000850529000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, mechanistic factors, particularly those driving long-term behavioral changes, are still being determined. Here, we capitalized on individual differences in oral cocaine self-administration patterns in adolescent mice and revealed that the post-synaptic protein PSD-95 was reduced in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) of escalating, but not stable, responders, which corresponded with later deficits in flexible decision-making behavior. Meanwhile, NMDA receptor GluN2B subunit content was lower in the OFC of mice that were resilient to escalatory oral cocaine seeking. This discovery led us to next co-administer the GluN2B-selective antagonist ifenprodil with cocaine, blocking the later emergence of cocaine-induced decision-making abnormalities. GluN2B inhibition also prevented cocaine-induced dysregulation of neuronal structure and function in the OFC, preserving mature, mushroom-shaped dendritic spine densities on deep-layer pyramidal neurons, which were otherwise lower with cocaine, and safeguarding functional BLA -> OFC connections necessary for action flexibility. We posit that cocaine potentiates GluN2B-dependent signaling, which triggers a series of durable adaptations that result in the dysregulation of post-synaptic neuronal structure in the OFC and disruption of BLA -> OFC connections, ultimately weakening the capacity for flexible choice. And thus, inhibiting GluN2B-NMDARs promotes resilience to long-term cocaine-related sequelae.",,,,,,,,10.1038/s41386-022-01437-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41386-022-01437-8,SEP 2022,36056105,WOS:000849156400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is widely held that parasite-mediated sexual selection can further amplify the selective pressure on the host to overcome parasite infection. In this paper we focus on certain types of parasites, those that can impair the activity of the host immune function to prevent signs of sickness. We show that the effect of sexual selection can actually reduce the selective pressure on the host immune response to adapt to the parasite infection. We design a simple mathematical model for a population of sexually reproducing organism in which individuals are choosy, preferring traits that are correlated negatively with immune system activity. We introduce to this population a parasite that can suppress activation of the host's immune response. Our results show that even though the host immune system is likely to ultimately evolve and adapt to the parasite infection, when sexual selection is part of this process, it can slow down this evolution on the host and give the parasite more time to get established.(c) 2022 The Authors.

However, only a minority of patients experience durable clinical benefit with immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy in most disease settings. Spurred by preclinical and correlative studies to understand mechanisms of non-response to the PD-(L)1 antagonists and by combination studies in animal tumor models, many drug development programs were designed to combine anti-PD-(L)1 with a variety of approved and investigational chemotherapies, tumor-targeted therapies, antiangiogenic therapies, and other immunotherapies. Several immunotherapy combinations improved survival outcomes in a variety of indications including melanoma, lung, kidney, and liver cancer, among others. This immunotherapy renaissance, however, has led to many combinations being advanced to late-stage development without definitive predictive biomarkers, limited phase I and phase II data, or clinical trial designs that are not optimized for demonstrating the unique attributes of immune-related antitumor activity-for example, landmark progression-free survival and overall survival. The decision to activate a study at an individual site is investigator-driven, and generalized frameworks to evaluate the potential for phase III trials in immuno-oncology to yield positive data, particularly to increase the number of curative responses or otherwise advance the field have thus far been lacking. To assist in evaluating the potential value to patients and the immunotherapy field of phase III trials, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) has developed a checklist for investigators, described in this manuscript.

METHODS Eligible patients with treatment-naive ccRCC received nivolumab until progressive disease (PD), toxicity, or completing 96 treatment weeks (part A). Patients with PD before or stable disease at 48 weeks could receive salvage nivolumab/ipilimumab (part B). The primary end point was improvement in 1-year progression-free survival in patients with tumor PD-L1 expression > 20% versus 0%. RESULTS One hundred twenty-three patients were enrolled. The objective response rate (ORR) was 34.1% (95% CI, 25.8 to 43.2). ORR by International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium category was favorable-risk 57.1%, intermediate-risk/poor-risk 25.0%, and by sarcomatoid features 36.4%. The ORR was 26.9%, 50.0%, and 75.0% for patients with the tumor PD-L1 expression of 0, 1-20, or > 20%, respectively (trend test P value = .002). The median duration of response was 27.6 (19.3 to not reached) months, with 26 of 42 responders including 17 of 20 with favorable-risk disease remaining progression-free. The 1-year progression-free survival was 34.6% and 75.0% in the PD-L1 = 0% and > 20% categories, respectively (P = .050).

Systematically collected and analysed data on the aetiology of hospitalised diarrhoea in low-income and middle-income countries are needed to prioritise interventions. Methods We established the Global Pediatric Diarrhea Surveillance network, in which children under 5 years hospitalised with diarrhoea were enrolled at 33 sentinel surveillance hospitals in 28 low-income and middle-income countries. Randomly selected stool specimens were tested by quantitative PCR for 16 causes of diarrhoea. We estimated pathogen-specific attributable burdens of diarrhoeal hospitalisations and deaths. We incorporated country-level incidence to estimate the number of pathogen-specific deaths on a global scale. Results During 2017-2018, 29 502 diarrhoea hospitalisations were enrolled, of which 5465 were randomly selected and tested. Rotavirus was the leading cause of diarrhoea requiring hospitalisation (attributable fraction (AF) 33.3%; 95% CI 27.7 to 40.3), followed by Shigella (9.7%; 95% CI 7.7 to 11.6), norovirus (6.5%; 95% CI 5.4 to 7.6) and adenovirus 40/41 (5.5%; 95% CI 4.4 to 6.7). Rotavirus was the leading cause of hospitalised diarrhoea in all regions except the Americas, where the leading aetiologies were Shigella (19.2%; 95% CI 11.4 to 28.1) and norovirus (22.2%; 95% CI 17.5 to 27.9) in Central and South America, respectively. The proportion of hospitalisations attributable to rotavirus was approximately 50% lower in sites that had introduced rotavirus vaccine (AF 20.8%; 95% CI 18.0 to 24.1) compared with sites that had not (42.1%; 95% CI 33.2 to 53.4). Globally, we estimated 208 009 annual rotavirus-attributable deaths (95% CI 169 561 to 259 216), 62 853 Shigella-attributable deaths (95% CI 48 656 to 78 805), 36 922 adenovirus 40/41-attributable deaths (95% CI 28 469 to 46 672) and 35 914 norovirus-attributable deaths (95% CI 27 258 to 46 516).

Recently, the effect of air pollution on blood pressure among the elderly has attracted researchers' attention. However, the existing evi-dence is not consistent, given that positive, null, and negative outcomes are presented in the literature. In this study, we investigated the relationship between blood pressure (BP) and indices of air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, and air quality index) in a specific elderly population through a panel study to address this knowledge gap.Methods: We obtained repeated BP measurements from January 2017 to May 2019 in a panel of 619 elderly with a total of 5106 records in Nanjing, China. Data on daily indices of ambient air pollutants, including fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of < 2.5 mu m (PM2.5), < 10 mu m (PM10), and air quality index (AQI) of the same period were obtained. We evaluated the association between BP and average concentrations of air pollutants in the past one-week, two-week, and four-week lags before measuring the BP. The non-linear panel regression models were used with fixed-and mixed-effects to control age, gender, and temperature.Results: In the non-linear panel fixed-effects model, the average concentration of PM2.5 is significantly associated with systolic BP (SBP) at all lags but is only significantly correlated with diastolic BP (DBP) at a one-week lag. An interquartile range (IQR) increase of one-week average moving PM2.5 (38.86 mu g/m3) of our sample increases the SBP and DBP by 7.68% and 6.9%, respectively. PM10 shows the same pattern of effect on BP as PM2.5. AQI shows less significant associations with BP. In the non-linear mixed-effects model, the average concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 are significantly associated with SBP at all lags but have no significant effect on DBP at one-and two-week lags. AQI is only significantly associated with DBP at a one-week lag.Conclusions: Exposures to ambient particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) were associated with increased BP among older people, indicating a potential link between air pollution and the high prevalence of hypertension.

OBJECTIVES To identify subgroups of older adults with similar 24-hour activity rhythm characteristics and characterize associated depression symptoms and cognitive performance. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS From January to March 2022, a cross-sectional analysis of the 2011-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination and Survey (NHANES) accelerometer study was conducted. The NHANES used a multistage probability sample that was designed to be representative of noninstitutionalized adults in the US. The main analysis included participants 65 years or older who had accelerometer and depression measures weighted to represent approximately 32 million older adults. EXPOSURES Latent profile analysis identified subgroups with similar 24-hour activity pattern characteristics as measured using extended-cosine and nonparametric methods. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Covariate-adjusted sample-weighted regressions assessed associations of subgroup membership with (1) depression symptoms defined as 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scores of 10 or greater (PHQ-9) and (2) having at least psychometric mild cognitive impairment (p-MCI) defined as scoring less than 1 SD below the mean on a composite cognitive performance score. RESULTS The actual clustering sample size was 1800 (weighted: mean [SD] age. 72.9 [73] years; 57% female participants). Clustering identified 4 subgroups: (1) 677 earlier rising/robust (37.6%), (2) 587 shorter active period/less modelable (32.6%), (3)177 shorter active period/very weak (9.8%), and (4) 359 later settling/very weak (20.0%). The prevalence of a PHQ-9 score of 10 or greater differed significantly across groups (cluster 1, 3.5%; cluster 2, 4.7%; cluster 3, 7.5%; cluster 4, 9.0%; chi(2) P = .004). The prevalence of having at least p-MCI differed significantly across groups (cluster 1, 7.2%; cluster 2, 12.0%; cluster 3, 21.0%; duster 4, 18.0%; chi(2) P < .001). Five of 9 depression symptoms differed significantly across subgroups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cross-sectional study, findings indicate that approximately 1 in 5 older adults in the US may be classified in a subgroup with weak activity patterns and later settling, and approximately 1 in 10 may be classified in a subgroup with weak patterns and shorter active duration. Future research is needed to investigate the biologic processes related to these behavioral phenotypes, including why earlier and robust activity patterns appear protective, and whether modifying disrupted patterns improves outcomes.",OCT,2022,79,10,1023,1031,,10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2022.2573,http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2022.2573,AUG 2022,36044201,WOS:000848899600006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Eun-Hyung; Sanz, Ignacio",,Dysregulated naive B cells and de novo autoreactivity in severe COVID-19,NATURE,Article; Early Access,"Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection(1) has been associated with highly inflammatory immune activation since the earliest days of the COVID-19 pandemic(2-5). More recently, these responses have been associated with the emergence of self-reactive antibodies with pathologic potential(6-10), although their origins and resolution have remained unclear(11). Previously, we and others have identified extrafollicular B cell activation, a pathway associated with the formation of new autoreactive antibodies in chronic autoimmunity(12,13), as a dominant feature of severe and critical COVID-19 (refs. (14-18)). Here, using single-cell B cell repertoire analysis of patients with mild and severe disease, we identify the expansion of a naive-derived, low-mutation IgG1 population of antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) reflecting features of low selective pressure. These features correlate with progressive, broad, clinically relevant autoreactivity, particularly directed against nuclear antigens and carbamylated proteins, emerging 10-15 days after the onset of symptoms. Detailed analysis of the low-selection compartment shows a high frequency of clonotypes specific for both SARS-CoV-2 and autoantigens, including pathogenic autoantibodies against the glomerular basement membrane. We further identify the contraction of this pathway on recovery, re-establishment of tolerance standards and concomitant loss of acute-derived ASCs irrespective of antigen specificity. However, serological autoreactivity persists in a subset of patients with postacute sequelae, raising important questions as to the contribution of emerging autoreactivity to continuing symptomology on recovery. In summary, this study demonstrates the origins, breadth and resolution of autoreactivity in severe COVID-19, with implications for early intervention and the treatment of patients with post-COVID sequelae.",,,,,,,,10.1038/s41586-022-05273-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05273-0,AUG 2022,36044993,WOS:000861202700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, as with all complex diseases, robust identification of the genes dysregulated by noncoding variants typically driving GWAS discoveries has been challenging. Here, to complement GWASs and better define actionable biological targets, we analyzed sequence data from more than 30,000 patients with CD and 80,000 population controls. We directly implicate ten genes in general onset CD for the first time to our knowledge via association to coding variation, four of which lie within established CD GWAS loci. In nine instances, a single coding variant is significantly associated, and in the tenth, ATG4C, we see additionally a significantly increased burden of very rare coding variants in CD cases. In addition to reiterating the central role of innate and adaptive immune cells as well as autophagy in CD pathogenesis, these newly associated genes highlight the emerging role of mesenchymal cells in the development and maintenance of intestinal inflammation. Large-scale sequence-based analyses identify novel risk variants and susceptibility genes for Crohn's disease, and implicate mesenchymal cell-mediated intestinal homeostasis in disease etiology.",SEP,2022,54,9,1275,+,,10.1038/s41588-022-01156-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41588-022-01156-2,AUG 2022,36038634,WOS:000847272000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

OBJECTIVE To characterize the ability of school-aged children to self-collect nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 testing compared with collection by health care workers. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional study of 197 symptomatic children and adolescents aged 4 to 14 years old. Individuals were recruited based on results of testing in the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta system from July to August 2021. EXPOSURES Children and adolescents were given instructional material consisting of a short instructional video and a handout with written and visual steps for self-swab collection. Participants first provided a self-collected nasal swab. Health care workers then collected a second specimen. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomewas SARS-CoV-2 detection and relative quantitation by cycle threshold (Ct) in self- vs health care worker-collected nasal swabs when tested with a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test with Emergency Use Authorization. RESULTS Among the study participants, 108 of 194 (55.7%) were male and the median age was 9 years (IQR, 6-11). Of the 196 participants, 87 (44.4%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 105 (53.6%) tested negative by both self- and health care worker-collected swabs. Two children tested positive by self- or health care worker-collected swab alone; 1 child had an invalid health care worker swab. Compared with health care worker-collected swabs, self-collected swabs had 97.8%(95% CI, 94.7%-100.0%) and 98.1%(95% CI, 95.6%-100.0%) positive and negative percent agreement, respectively, and SARS-CoV-2 Ct values did not differ significantly between groups (mean [SD] Ct, self-swab: 26.7 [5.4] vs health care worker swab: 26.3 [6.0]; P =.65).

In a national sample of 45 FQHCs, we examined how patients' sociodemographic characteristics were associated with employee engagement in QI, via innovation contests that solicited ideas for improving care and offered opportunities to vote on ideas. We posited that patients' sociodemographic characteristics influence the complexity and intensity of clinical work and thus employees' capacity to engage in QI. Regression results indicated that the percentage of patients living in poverty was negatively associated with employee participation in idea submission and voting. Moreover, the percentage of Hispanic patients was negatively associated with participation in voting. The percentage of Black patients, however, was not associated with either outcome. FQHCs that serve a higher share of low income and/or Hispanic patients may face resource and personnel constraints that reduce employees' capacity to contribute to QI efforts.",,,,,,,,10.1177/10775587221118157,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10775587221118157,AUG 2022,36000499,WOS:000845020400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We analysed results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 to inform cancer control planning efforts globally. Methods The GBD 2019 comparative risk assessment framework was used to estimate cancer burden attributable to behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risk factors. A total of 82 risk-outcome pairs were included on the basis of the World Cancer Research Fund criteria. Estimated cancer deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in 2019 and change in these measures between 2010 and 2019 are presented. Findings Globally, in 2019, the risk factors included in this analysis accounted for 4.45 million (95% uncertainty interval 4.01-4.94) deaths and 105 million (95.0-116) DALYs for both sexes combined, representing 44.4% (41.3-48.4) of all cancer deaths and 42.0% (39.1-45.6) of all DALYs. There were 2.88 million (2.60-3.18) risk-attributable cancer deaths in males (50.6% [47.8-54.1] of all male cancer deaths) and 1.58 million (1.36-1.84) risk-attributable cancer deaths in females (36.3% [32.5-41.3] of all female cancer deaths). The leading risk factors at the most detailed level globally for risk-attributable cancer deaths and DALYs in 2019 for both sexes combined were smoking, followed by alcohol use and high BMI. Risk-attributable cancer burden varied by world region and Socio-demographic Index (SDI), with smoking, unsafe sex, and alcohol use being the three leading risk factors for risk-attributable cancer DALYs in low SDI locations in 2019, whereas DALYs in high SDI locations mirrored the top three global risk factor rankings. From 2010 to 2019, global risk-attributable cancer deaths increased by 20.4% (12.6-28.4) and DALYs by 16.8% (8.8-25.0), with the greatest percentage increase in metabolic risks (34.7% [27.9-42.8] and 33.3% [25.8-42.0]). Interpretation The leading risk factors contributing to global cancer burden in 2019 were behavioural, whereas metabolic risk factors saw the largest increases between 2010 and 2019. Reducing exposure to these modifiable risk factors would decrease cancer mortality and DALY rates worldwide, and policies should be tailored appropriately to local cancer risk factor burden.

In the last decade, there has been an unprecedented increase in the number and visibility of transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people seeking support and gender-affirming medical treatment in parallel with a significant rise in the scientific literature in this area. The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) is an international, multidisciplinary, professional association whose mission is to promote evidence-based care, education, research, public policy, and respect in transgender health. One of the main functions of WPATH is to promote the highest standards of health care for TGD people through the Standards of Care (SOC). The SOC was initially developed in 1979 and the last version (SOC-7) was published in 2012. In view of the increasing scientific evidence, WPATH commissioned a new version of the Standards of Care, the SOC-8. Aim: The overall goal of SOC-8 is to provide health care professionals (HCPs) with clinical guidance to assist TGD people in accessing safe and effective pathways to achieving lasting personal comfort with their gendered selves with the aim of optimizing their overall physical health, psychological well-being, and self-fulfillment. Methods: The SOC-8 is based on the best available science and expert professional consensus in transgender health. International professionals and stakeholders were selected to serve on the SOC-8 committee. Recommendation statements were developed based on data derived from independent systematic literature reviews, where available, background reviews and expert opinions. Grading of recommendations was based on the available evidence supporting interventions, a discussion of risks and harms, as well as the feasibility and acceptability within different contexts and country settings. Results: A total of 18 chapters were developed as part of the SOC-8. They contain recommendations for health care professionals who provide care and treatment for TGD people. Each of the recommendations is followed by explanatory text with relevant references. General areas related to transgender health are covered in the chapters Terminology, Global Applicability, Population Estimates, and Education. The chapters developed for the diverse population of TGD people include Assessment of Adults, Adolescents, Children, Nonbinary, Eunuchs, and Intersex Individuals, and people living in Institutional Environments. Finally, the chapters related to gender-affirming treatment are Hormone Therapy, Surgery and Postoperative Care, Voice and Communication, Primary Care, Reproductive Health, Sexual Health, and Mental Health. Conclusions: The SOC-8 guidelines are intended to be flexible to meet the diverse health care needs of TGD people globally. While adaptable, they offer standards for promoting optimal health care and guidance for the treatment of people experiencing gender incongruence. As in all previous versions of the SOC, the criteria set forth in this document for gender-affirming medical interventions are clinical guidelines; individual health care professionals and programs may modify these in consultation with the TGD person.",AUG 19,2022,23,,S1,S258,,10.1080/26895269.2022.2100644,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/26895269.2022.2100644,,36238954,WOS:000854026600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Clinically relevant stem/progenitor cells in a rodent model of acute myocardial infarction (MI) demonstrated that neonatal cardiac mesenchymal stromal cells (nMSCs) provide the most robust cardiac functional recovery. Transplanted nMSCs significantly increased the number of tissue reparative macrophages and regulatory T-cells and decreased monocyte-derived inflammatory macrophages and neutrophils in the host myocardium. mRNA microarray and single-cell analyses combined with targeted depletion studies established CD47 in nMSCs as a key molecule responsible for cell retention in the myocardium through an antiphagocytic mechanism regulated by miR34a-5p. Gain and loss-of-function studies demonstrated that miR34a-5p also regulated the production of exosomes and cardioprotective paracrine factors in the nMSC secretome.

Methods In this phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we used a 2-by-3 factorial design to test the effectiveness of three repurposed drugs - metformin, ivermectin, and fluvoxamine - in preventing serious SARS-CoV-2 infection in nonhospitalized adults who had been enrolled within 3 days after a confirmed diagnosis of infection and less than 7 days after the onset of symptoms. The patients were between the ages of 30 and 85 years, and all had either overweight or obesity. The primary composite end point was hypoxemia (<= 93% oxygen saturation on home oximetry), emergency department visit, hospitalization, or death. All analyses used controls who had undergone concurrent randomization and were adjusted for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and receipt of other trial medications. Results A total of 1431 patients underwent randomization; of these patients, 1323 were included in the primary analysis. The median age of the patients was 46 years; 56% were female (6% of whom were pregnant), and 52% had been vaccinated. The adjusted odds ratio for a primary event was 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66 to 1.09; P=0.19) with metformin, 1.05 (95% CI, 0.76 to 1.45; P=0.78) with ivermectin, and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.66 to 1.36; P=0.75) with fluvoxamine. In prespecified secondary analyses, the adjusted odds ratio for emergency department visit, hospitalization, or death was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.35 to 0.94) with metformin, 1.39 (95% CI, 0.72 to 2.69) with ivermectin, and 1.17 (95% CI, 0.57 to 2.40) with fluvoxamine. The adjusted odds ratio for hospitalization or death was 0.47 (95% CI, 0.20 to 1.11) with metformin, 0.73 (95% CI, 0.19 to 2.77) with ivermectin, and 1.11 (95% CI, 0.33 to 3.76) with fluvoxamine. Conclusions None of the three medications that were evaluated prevented the occurrence of hypoxemia, an emergency department visit, hospitalization, or death associated with Covid-19.

We explored the genes disrupted by these variants from joint analysis of protein-truncating variants (PTVs), missense variants and copy number variants (CNVs) in a cohort of 63,237 individuals. We discovered 72 genes associated with ASD at false discovery rate (FDR) <= 0.001 (185 at FDR <= 0.05). De novo PTVs, damaging missense variants and CNVs represented 57.5%, 21.1% and 8.44% of association evidence, while CNVs conferred greatest relative risk. Meta-analysis with cohorts ascertained for developmental delay (DD) (n = 91,605) yielded 373 genes associated with ASD/DD at FDR <= 0.001 (664 at FDR <= 0.05), some of which differed in relative frequency of mutation between ASD and DD cohorts. The DD-associated genes were enriched in transcriptomes of progenitor and immature neuronal cells, whereas genes showing stronger evidence in ASD were more enriched in maturing neurons and overlapped with schizophrenia-associated genes, emphasizing that these neuropsychiatric disorders may share common pathways to risk.",SEP,2022,54,9,1320,+,,10.1038/s41588-022-01104-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41588-022-01104-0,AUG 2022,35982160,WOS:000842689300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

These quiescent cells reside in lymphoid tissues, are critical for maintaining the CD8 T cell response under conditions of persistent antigen, and provide the proliferative burst after PD-1 blockade. Here we examined the role of TGF-beta in regulating the differentiation of virus-specific CD8 T cells during chronic LCMV infection of mice. We found that TGF-beta signaling was not essential for the generation of the stem-like CD8 T cells but was critical for maintaining the stem-like state and quiescence of these cells. TGF-beta regulated the unique transcriptional program of the stem-like subset, including upregulation of inhibitory receptors specifically expressed on these cells. TGF-beta also promoted the terminal differentiation of exhausted CD8 T cells by suppressing the effector-associated program. Together, the absence of TGF-beta signaling resulted in significantly increased accumulation of effector-like CD8 T cells. These findings have implications for immunotherapies in general and especially for T cell therapy against chronic infections and cancer. This study demonstrates the role of TGF-beta on virus-specific CD8 T cell differentiation during chronic LCMV infection. TGF-beta maintains the stem-like state of TCF-1(+) CD8 T cells and promotes terminal differentiation of exhausted cells by suppressing effector- and proliferation-associated programs.",AUG 18,2022,219,10,,,e20211574,10.1084/jem.20211574,http://dx.doi.org/10.1084/jem.20211574,,35980386,WOS:000860480500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the field of dissemination research has not coalesced to the same degree as the field of implementation research. To advance the field of dissemination research, this review aimed to (1) identify the extent to which dissemination frameworks are used in dissemination empirical studies, (2) examine how scholars define dissemination, and (3) identify key constructs from dissemination frameworks. Methods To achieve aims 1 and 2, we conducted a scoping review of dissemination studies published in D&I science journals. The search strategy included manuscripts published from 1985 to 2020. Articles were included if they were empirical quantitative or mixed methods studies about the dissemination of information to a professional audience. Studies were excluded if they were systematic reviews, commentaries or conceptual papers, scale-up or scale-out studies, qualitative or case studies, or descriptions of programs. To achieve aim 1, we compiled the frameworks identified in the empirical studies. To achieve aim 2, we compiled the definitions from dissemination from frameworks identified in aim 1 and from dissemination frameworks identified in a 2021 review (Tabak RG, Am J Prev Med 43:337-350, 2012). To achieve aim 3, we compile the constructs and their definitions from the frameworks. Findings Out of 6017 studies, 89 studies were included for full-text extraction. Of these, 45 (51%) used a framework to guide the study. Across the 45 studies, 34 distinct frameworks were identified, out of which 13 (38%) defined dissemination. There is a lack of consensus on the definition of dissemination. Altogether, we identified 48 constructs, divided into 4 categories: process, determinants, strategies, and outcomes. Constructs in the frameworks are not well defined. Implication for D&I research This study provides a critical step in the dissemination research literature by offering suggestions on how to define dissemination research and by cataloging and defining dissemination constructs. Strengthening these definitions and distinctions between D&I research could enhance scientific reproducibility and advance the field of dissemination research.",AUG 9,2022,17,1,,,53,10.1186/s13012-022-01225-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13012-022-01225-4,,35945548,WOS:000838078800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It remains uncertain whether intravenous tirofiban is effective to improve functional outcomes for patients with large vessel occlusion ischemic stroke undergoing endovascular thrombectomy. OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy and adverse events of intravenous tirofiban before endovascular thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke secondary to large vessel occlusion. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This investigator-initiated, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was implemented at 55 hospitals in China, enrolling 948 patients with stroke and proximal intracranial large vessel occlusion presenting within 24 hours of time last known well. Recruitment took place between October 10, 2018, and October 31, 2021, with final follow-up on January 15, 2022. INTERVENTIONS Participants received intravenous tirofiban (n = 463) or placebo (n = 485) prior to endovascular thrombectomy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was disability level at 90 days as measured by overall distribution of the modified Rankin Scale scores from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (death). The primary safety outcome was the incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 48 hours. RESULTS Among 948 patients randomized (mean age, 67 years; 391 [41.2%] women), 948 (100%) completed the trial. The median (IQR) 90-day modified Rankin Scale score in the tirofiban group vs placebo group was 3 (1-4) vs 3 (1-4). The adjusted common odds ratio for a lower level of disability with tirofiban vs placebo was 1.08 (95% CI, 0.86-1.36). Incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was 9.7% in the tirofiban group vs 6.4% in the placebo group (difference, 3.3% [95% CI, 02% to 6,8%]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke undergoing endovascular thrombectomy, treatment with intravenous tirofiban, compared with placebo, before endovascular therapy resulted in no significant difference in disability severity at 90 days. The findings do not support use of intravenous tirofiban before endovascular thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke.",AUG 9,2022,328,6,543,553,,10.1001/jama.2022.12584,http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.2022.12584,,35943471,WOS:000847850400017,View Full Record in Web of Science

An alternative to physical robots is to use virtual environments. Here, we designed and built a modular, audio-visual 2D virtual environment that allows multi-modal, multi-agent interaction to study mechanisms underlying social communication. The strength of the system is an implementation based on event processing that allows for complex computation. We tested this system in songbirds, which provide an exceptionally powerful and tractable model system to study social communication. We show that pair-bonded zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) communicating through the virtual environment exhibit normal call timing behaviour, males sing female directed song and both males and females display high-intensity courtship behaviours to their mates. These results suggest that the environment provided is sufficiently natural to elicit these behavioral responses. Furthermore, as an example of complex behavioral annotation, we developed a fully unsupervised song motif detector and used it to manipulate the virtual social environment of male zebra finches based on the number of motifs sung. Our virtual environment represents a first step in real-time automatic behaviour annotation and animal-computer interaction using higher level behaviours such as song. Our unsupervised acoustic analysis eliminates the need for annotated training data thus reducing labour investment and experimenter bias.",AUG 4,2022,12,1,,,13414,10.1038/s41598-022-16456-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-16456-0,,35927295,WOS:000836406600070,View Full Record in Web of Science

Million Hearts (US Department of Health and Human Ser-vices) is a national initiative that promotes a set of priorities and interventions to optimize delivery of evidence-based strategies to manage cardiovascular disease, including hypertension. The COVID-19 pandemic, however, has disrupted routine care and preventive service delivery. We identified examples of clinical and health organizations that adapted services and care processes to continue a focus on monitoring and controlling hypertension dur-ing the pandemic. Eight Hypertension Control Exemplars were identified and interviewed. They reported various adapted care strategies including telemedicine, engaging patients in self -measured blood pressure monitoring, adapting or implementing medication management services, activating partnerships to re-spond to patient needs or expand services, and implementing unique patient outreach approaches. Documenting these hyperten-sion control strategies can help increase adoption of adaptive ap-proaches during public health emergencies and routine care.",AUG,2022,19,,,,,10.5888/pcd19.210439,http://dx.doi.org/10.5888/pcd19.210439,,35926561,WOS:000841156500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

There is some evidence to suggest that major differences exist in treatment outcomes for children with retinoblastoma from different regions, but these differences have not been assessed on a global scale. We aimed to report 3-year outcomes for children with retinoblastoma globally and to investigate factors associated with survival. Methods We did a prospective cluster-based analysis of treatment-naive patients with retinoblastoma who were diagnosed between Jan 1,2017, and Dec 31,2017, then treated and followed up for 3 years. Patients were recruited from 260 specialised treatment centres worldwide. Data were obtained from participating centres on primary and additional treatments, duration of follow-up, metastasis, eye globe salvage, and survival outcome. We analysed time to death and time to enucleation with Cox regression models. Findings The cohort included 4064 children from 149 countries. The median age at diagnosis was 23.2 months (IQR 11.0-36.5). Extraocular tumour spread (cT4 of the cTNMH classification) at diagnosis was reported in five (0.8%) of 636 children from high-income countries, 55 (5.4%) of 1027 children from upper-middle-income countries, 342 (19. 7%) of 1738 children from lower-middle-income countries, and 196 (42.9%) of 457 children from low-income countries. Enudeation surgery was available for all children and intravenous chemotherapy was available for 4014 (98.8%) of 4064 children. The 3-year survival rate was 99.5% (95% CI 98.8-100.0) for children from high-income countries, 91.2% (89.5-93.0) for children from upper-middle-income countries, 80.3% (78.3-82.3) for children from lower-middle-income countries, and 57.3% (524-63-0) for children from low-income countries. On analysis, independent factors for worse survival were residence in low-income countries compared to high-income countries (hazard ratio 16.67; 95% CI 4.76-50.00), cT4 advanced tumour compared to cT1 (8.98; 4.44-18.18), and older age at diagnosis in children up to 3 years (1.38 per year; 1.23-1.56). For children aged 3-7 years, the mortality risk decreased slightly (p=0.0104 for the change in slope). Interpretation This study, estimated to include approximately half of all new retinoblastoma cases worldwide in 2017, shows profound inequity in survival of children depending on the national income level of their country of residence. In high-income countries, death from retinoblastoma is rare, whereas in low-income countries estimated 3-year survival is just over 50%. Although essential treatments are available in nearly all countries, early diagnosis and treatment in low-income countries are key to improving survival outcomes. Copyright (C) 2022 The Author(s).

However, the effect of self-management among young adults with irritable bowel syndrome is limited. Objectives: This study aimed to examine the effect of a nurse-led self-management program on pain, symptoms, and quality of life among young adults with irritable bowel syndrome. Design: A randomized controlled trial. Settings and participants: Eighty young adults with irritable bowel syndrome recruited from two campuses of a public university and two gastrointestinal clinics were randomly assigned into a self-management online education and learning modules alone group (Online Modules, n = 41) or a nurse-led one-to-one consultation plus self-management online education and learning modules group (Nurse-Led Online Modules, n = 39). Twenty-one healthy controls were also recruited from these two campuses. Methods: Both the intervention groups received ten online modules after baseline data collection. Participants in the Nurse-Led Online Modules group received additional three nurse-led one-to-one consultations at baseline, 6- and 12-week follow-ups. Self-reported pain, symptoms, quality of life, self-efficacy for managing chronic disease, and coping were measured at baseline, and 6- and 12-week follow-ups among the participants with irritable bowel syndrome. The healthy controls completed data collection of pain and symptoms at baseline and the 12-week follow-up. The intervention effects across study time points and the comparisons between the two interventional groups were analyzed using linear mixed models. A longitudinal mediation analysis was also conducted to explore the mediation effects of self-management mechanisms of the interventions. Results: Both the intervention groups showed significant interventional effects on decreasing pain intensity and pain interference and increasing quality of life at the 12-week follow-up (all p < 0.05). At the 12-week follow-up, the Nurse-Led Online Modules significantly reduced anxiety (p = 0.016) and had a significant greater improvement in quality of life than the Online Modules (p = 0.040). Increased self-efficacy mediated the intervention effect of the Nurse-Led Online Modules group on reducing pain interference and improving quality of life, while the effect of the Online Modules was mediated through decreasing inefficient coping strategy-catastrophizing. Conclusions: This study showed that both the pain self-management online education and nurse-led intervention were effective for alleviating pain and improving quality of life among young adults with irritable bowel syndrome by targeting the self-management process. The nurse-led intervention had a better outcome than the online education alone in improving quality of life. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Following multicenter selective lymphadenectomy trial-II, most patients with SLN+ melanoma no longer undergo a CLND prior to adjuvant systemic therapy. A retrospective analysis of clinical outcomes in SLN+ melanoma patients treated with adjuvant systemic therapy after July 2017 was performed in 21 international cancer centers. Of 462 patients who received systemic adjuvant therapy, 326 patients received adjuvant anti-PD-1 without prior immediate (IM) CLND, while 60 underwent IM CLND. With median follow-up of 21 months, 24-month relapse-free survival (RFS) was 67% (95% CI 62% to 73%) in the 326 patients. When the patient subgroups who would have been eligible for the two adjuvant anti-PD-1 clinical trials mandating IM CLND were analyzed separately, 24-month RFS rates were 64%, very similar to the RFS rates from those studies. Of these no-CLND patients, those with SLN tumor deposit >1 mm, stage IIIC/D and ulcerated primary had worse RFS. Of the patients who relapsed on adjuvant anti-PD-1, those without IM CLND had a higher rate of relapse in the regional nodal basin than those with IM CLND (46% vs 11%).

We report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of coronary artery disease (CAD) incorporating nearly a quarter of a million cases, in which existing studies are integrated with data from cohorts of white, Black and Hispanic individuals from the Million Veteran Program. We document near equivalent heritability of CAD across multiple ancestral groups, identify 95 novel loci, including nine on the X chromosome, detect eight loci of genome-wide significance in Black and Hispanic individuals, and demonstrate that two common haplotypes at the 9p21 locus are responsible for risk stratification in all populations except those of African origin, in which these haplotypes are virtually absent. Moreover, in the largest GWAS for angiographically derived coronary atherosclerosis performed to date, we find 15 loci of genome-wide significance that robustly overlap with established loci for clinical CAD. Phenome-wide association analyses of novel loci and polygenic risk scores (PRSs) augment signals related to insulin resistance, extend pleiotropic associations of these loci to include smoking and family history, and precisely document the markedly reduced transferability of existing PRSs to Black individuals. Downstream integrative analyses reinforce the critical roles of vascular endothelial, fibroblast, and smooth muscle cells in CAD susceptibility, but also point to a shared biology between atherosclerosis and oncogenesis.

Background: Given the ongoing need for online delivery of both nursing education and clinical practice, providers must continue to find approaches to facilitate the provision of empathetic and personalized care to achieve optimal patient outcomes. Motivational interviewing integrates a person-centered approach with specific communication strategies to encourage and support patients' commitment to change. Motivational interviewing skills can be implemented across a wide variety of patient situations, including mental health and primary nursing care. Design: The study followed a pre-/post-test cross-sectional observational design. Methods: After completing an online training course to learn motivational interviewing skills, students participated in an online simulation with a standardized patient portraying a woman with substance use disorder during pregnancy. Prior to the simulation, students completed the Caring Behaviors Inventory-24 and the Opening Minds Scale for Health Care Providers. After the simulation, students and standardized patients completed the Simulated Clinical Interview Rating Scale and a 5-item version of the Caring Behaviors Inventory 6. Results: Of the 252 students in the course, 85 (34%) participated in the study. Twenty-six student participants completed both pre-and post-simulation questionnaires; 40 completed only pre-simulation questionnaires; and 19 completed only post-simulation questionnaires. Prior to the simulated patient encounter, students rated themselves most favorably on ability to demonstrate assurance behaviors. After the training and simulation, students and standardized patients reported successful student demonstration of motivational interviewing skills and caring behaviors consistent with fundamental therapeutic communication and motivational interviewing knowledge.

METHODS: We performed content analysis of outpatient oncology encounters at two US National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers audio recorded between November 2010 and September 2014. A multidisciplinary team used a hybrid approach of inductive and deductive coding and theme development. We used a combination of random and purposive sampling. We restricted quantitative frequency counts to the coded random sample but included all sampled encounters in qualitative thematic analysis. RESULTS: Among 31 randomly sampled dyads with three encounters each, systemic therapy decision making was discussed in 90% (84 of 93) encounters. Thirty-four (37%) broached limiting therapy, which 27 (79%) framed as temporary, nine (26%) as completion of a standard regimen, and five (15%) as permanent discontinuation. Thematic analysis of these 93 encounters, plus five encounters purposively sampled for permanent discontinuation, found that (1) patients and oncologists framed continuing therapy as the default, (2) deficiencies in the SDM process (facilitating choice awareness, discussing options, and incorporating patient preferences) contributed to this default, and (3) oncologists use persuasion rather than deliberation when broaching discontinuation. CONCLUSION: In this study of outpatient encounters between patients with advanced cancer and their oncologists, when discussing systemic therapy, there exists a default to continue systemic therapy, and deficiencies in SDM contribute to this default.",AUG,2022,18,8,598,+,,10.1200/OP.21.00377,http://dx.doi.org/10.1200/OP.21.00377,,34855459,WOS:000839669700027,View Full Record in Web of Science

These chemical alterations can be found on either the ribose sugar or the nucleobase, and although many are silent  and do not change the Watson-Crick-Franklin code of the RNA, others result in recoding events. More than 170 RNA modifications have been identified so far, each having a specific biological purpose. Additionally, dysregulated RNA editing has been linked to several types of diseases and disorders. As new modifications are discovered and our understanding of their functional impact grows, so does the need for selective methods of identifying and mapping editing sites in the transcriptome. The most common methods for studying RNA modifications rely on antibodies as affinity reagents; however, antibodies can be difficult to generate and often have undesirable off-target binding. More recently, selective chemical labeling has advanced the field by offering techniques that can be used for the detection, enrichment, and quantification of RNA modifications. In our method using acrylamide for inosine labeling, we demonstrated the versatility with which this approach enables pull-down or downstream functionalization with other tags or affinity handles. Although this method did enable the quantitative analysis of A-to-I editing levels, we found that selectivity posed a significant limitation, likely because of the similar reactivity profiles of inosine and pseudouridine or other nucleobases.Seeking to overcome the inherent limitations of antibodies and chemical labeling methods, a more recent approach to studying the epitranscriptome is through the repurposing of proteins and enzymes that recognize modified RNA. Our laboratory has used Endonuclease V, a repair enzyme that cleaves inosine-containing RNAs, and reprogrammed it to instead bind inosine. We first harnessed EndoV to develop a preparative technique for RNA sequencing that we termed EndoVIPER-seq. This method uses EndoV to enrich inosine-edited RNAs, providing better coverage in RNA sequencing and leading to the discovery of previously undetected A-to-I editing sites. We also leveraged EndoV to create a plate-based immunoassay (EndoVLISA) to quantify inosine in cellular RNA. This approach can detect differential A-to-I editing levels across tissue types or disease states while being independent of RNA sequencing, making it cost-effective and high-throughput. By harnessing the molecular recognition capabilities of this enzyme, we show that EndoV can be repurposed as an anti-inosine antibody  to develop new methods of detecting and enriching inosine from cellular RNA. Nature has evolved a plethora of proteins and enzymes that selectively recognize and act on RNA modifications, and exploiting the affinity of these biomolecules offers a promising new direction for the field of epitranscriptomics.",,,,,,,,10.1021/acs.accounts.2c00287,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.accounts.2c00287,JUL 2022,35900335,WOS:000835223100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

MDCK-SIAT1 (SIAT1) and humanized MDCK (hCK) cell lines are engineered MDCK cells that express N-glycans with elevated levels of sialic acid (Sia) in alpha 2,6-linkage (alpha 2,6-Sia) that are recognized by many human IAVs. To characterize the N-glycan structures in these cells and the potential changes compared to the parental MDCK cell line resulting from engineering, we analyzed the N-glycans from these cells at different passages, using both mass spectrometry and specific lectin and antibody binding. We observed significant differences between the three cell lines in overall complex N-glycans and terminal galactose modifications. MDCK cells express core fucosylated, bisected complex-type N-glycans at all passage stages, in addition to expressing alpha 2,6-Sia on short N-glycans and alpha 2,3-Sia on larger N-glycans. By contrast, SIAT1 cells predominantly express alpha 2,6-Sia glycans and greatly reduced level of alpha 2,3-Sia glycans. Additionally, they express bisected, sialylated N-glycans that are scant in MDCK cells. The hCK cells exclusively express alpha 2,6-Sia glycans. Unexpectedly, hCK glycoproteins bound robustly to the plant lectin MAL-1, indicating alpha 2,3-Sia glycans, but such binding was not Sia-dependent and closely mirrored that of an antibody that recognizes glycans with terminal 3-O-sulfate galactose (3-O-SGal).

Treatment with vismodegib, an SHH inhibitor that acts on Smoothened (Smo), led to increases in astrocyte-like Sox2(+) cells. Using SOX2-enriched MB cultures, we observed that SOX2(+) cells required SHH signaling to propagate, and unlike in the proliferative tumor bulk, the SHH pathway was activated in these cells downstream of Smo in an MYC-dependent manner.

The dynamics captured by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data are noisy, high-dimensional, and not readily interpretable. The typical approach of reducing this data to low-dimensional features and focusing on the most predictive features comes with strong assumptions and can miss essential aspects of the underlying dynamics. In contrast, introspection of discriminatively trained deep learning models may uncover disorder-relevant elements of the signal at the level of individual time points and spatial locations. Yet, the difficulty of reliable training on high-dimensional low sample size datasets and the unclear relevance of the resulting predictive markers prevent the widespread use of deep learning in functional neuroimaging. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework to learn from high-dimensional dynamical data while maintaining stable, ecologically valid interpretations. Results successfully demonstrate that the proposed framework enables learning the dynamics of resting-state fMRI directly from small data and capturing compact, stable interpretations of features predictive of function and dysfunction.",JUL 21,2022,12,1,,,12023,10.1038/s41598-022-15539-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-15539-2,,35864279,WOS:000828780000007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Small amounts of alcohol might lower the risk of some health outcomes but increase the risk of others, suggesting that the overall risk depends, in part, on background disease rates, which vary by region, age, sex, and year. Methods For this analysis, we constructed burden-weighted dose-response relative risk curves across 22 health outcomes to estimate the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL) and non-drinker equivalence (NDE), the consumption level at which the health risk is equivalent to that of a non-drinker, using disease rates from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2020 for 21 regions, including 204 countries and territories, by 5-year age group, sex, and year for individuals aged 15-95 years and older from 1990 to 2020. Based on the NDE, we quantified the population consuming harmful amounts of alcohol. Findings The burden-weighted relative risk curves for alcohol use varied by region and age. Among individuals aged 15-39 years in 2020, the TMREL varied between 0 (95% uncertainty interval 0-0) and 0.603 (0.400-1.00) standard drinks per day, and the NDE varied between 0.002 (0-0) and 1.75 (0.698-4.30) standard drinks per day. Among individuals aged 40 years and older, the burden-weighted relative risk curve was J-shaped for all regions, with a 2020 TMREL that ranged from 0.114 (0-0.403) to 1.87 (0.500-3.30) standard drinks per day and an NDE that ranged between 0.193 (0-0.900) and 6.94 (3.40-8.30) standard drinks per day. Among individuals consuming harmful amounts of alcohol in 2020, 59.1% (54.3-65.4) were aged 15-39 years and 76.9% (73.0-81.3) were male. Interpretation There is strong evidence to support recommendations on alcohol consumption varying by age and location. Stronger interventions, particularly those tailored towards younger individuals, are needed to reduce the substantial global health loss attributable to alcohol. Copyright (C) 2022 The Author(s).

However, there are still gaps in knowledge about their environmental fate and health implications. More attention is needed for remote locations with source exposures. This study focuses on assessing PFAS exposure in Gustavus, a small Alaska community, located near a significant PFAS source from airport operations and fire training sites. Residential water (n = 25) and serum (n = 40) samples were collected from Gustavus residents and analyzed for 39 PFAS compounds. In addition, two water samples were collected from the previously identified PFAS source near the community. Fourteen distinct PFAS were detected in Gustavus water samples, including 6 perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs), 7 perfluorosulfonic acids (PFSAs), and 1 fluorotelomer sulfonate (FTS). & USigma;PFAS concentrations in residential drinking water ranged from not detected to 120 ng/L. High & USigma;PFAS levels were detected in two source samples collected from the Gustavus Department of Transportation (14,600 ng/L) and the Gustavus Airport (228 ng/L), confirming these two locations as a nearby major source of PFAS contamination. Seventeen PFAS were detected in serum and & USigma;PFAS concentrations ranged from 0.0170 to 13.1 ng/mL (median 0.0823 ng/mL). Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) were the most abundant PFAS in both water and serum samples and comprised up to 70% of & USigma;PFAS concentrations in these samples. Spearman's correlation analysis revealed PFAS concentrations in water and sera were significantly and positively correlated (r = 0.495; p = 0.0192).

Using a multi-disciplinary approach, we explore the hypothesis that the biophysical alterations of red blood cells (RBCs) in IDA, such as variable degrees of microcytosis and decreased deform -ability may directly induce endothelial dysfunction via mechanobiological mecha-nisms. Using a combination of atomic force microscopy and microfluidics, we observed that subpopulations of IDA RBCs (idRBCs) are significantly stiffer and smaller than both healthy RBCs and the remaining idRBC population. Further-more, computational simulations demonstrated that the smaller and stiffer idRBC subpopulations marginate toward the vessel wall causing aberrant shear stresses. This leads to increased vascular inflammation as confirmed with perfu-sion of idRBCs into our ''endothelialized'' microfluidic systems.

In our analysis of patients of European (n = 2,249) and African (n = 835) ancestries with hospitalized versus nonhospitalized COVID-19, the risk of hospitalized disease was associated with a common OAS1 haplotype, which was also associated with reduced severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) clearance in a clinical trial with pegIFN-lambda 1.

Erythropoietin has been hypothesized to have neuroprotective effects in infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, but its effects on neurodevelopmental outcomes when given in conjunction with therapeutic hypothermia are unknown. METHODS In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we assigned 501 infants born at 36 weeks or more of gestation with moderate or severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy to receive erythropoietin or placebo, in conjunction with standard therapeutic hypothermia. Erythropoietin (1000 U per kilogram of body weight) or saline placebo was administered intravenously within 26 hours after birth, as well as at 2, 3, 4, and 7 days of age. The primary outcome was death or neurodevelopmental impairment at 22 to 36 months of age. Neurodevelopmental impairment was defined as cerebral palsy, a Gross Motor Function Classification System level of at least 1 (on a scale of 0 [normal] to 5 [most impaired]), or a cognitive score of less than 90 (which corresponds to 0.67 SD below the mean, with higher scores indicating better performance) on the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, third edition. RESULTS Of 500 infants in the modified intention-to-treat analysis, 257 received erythropoietin and 243 received placebo. The incidence of death or neurodevelopmental impairment was 52.5% in the erythropoietin group and 49.5% in the placebo group (relative risk, 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86 to 1.24; P=0.74). The mean number of serious adverse events per child was higher in the erythropoietin group than in the placebo group (0.86 vs. 0.67; relative risk, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.57). CONCLUSIONS The administration of erythropoietin to newborns undergoing therapeutic hypothermia for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy did not result in a lower risk of death or neurodevelopmental impairment than placebo and was associated with a higher rate of serious adverse events. number, .)",JUL 14,2022,387,2,148,159,,10.1056/NEJMoa2119660,http://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2119660,,35830641,WOS:000835654500010,View Full Record in Web of Science

We sought to identify mechanisms of immune suppression in B-ALL and strategies to overcome them. Plasma collected from children with B-ALL with measurable residual disease after induction chemotherapy showed differential cytokine expression, particularly IL-7, while single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed the expression of genes associated with immune exhaustion in immune cell subsets. We also found that the supernatant of leukemia cells suppressed T-cell function ex vivo. Modeling B-ALL in mice, we observed an altered tumor immune microenvironment, including compromised activation of T-cells and dendritic cells (DC). However, recombinant IL-12 (rIL-12) treatment of mice with B-ALL restored the levels of several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the bone marrow and increased the number of splenic and bone marrow resident T-cells and DCs. RNA-sequencing of T-cells isolated from vehicle and rIL-12 treated mice with B-ALL revealed that the leukemia-induced increase in genes associated with exhaustion, including Lag3, Tigit, and Il10, was abrogated with rIL-12 treatment. In addition, the cytolytic capacity of T-cells co-cultured with B-ALL cells was enhanced when IL-12 and blinatumomab treatments were combined. Overall, these results demonstrate that the leukemia immune suppressive microenvironment can be restored with rIL-12 treatment which has direct therapeutic implications.",JUL 13,2022,12,1,,,11870,10.1038/s41598-022-16152-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-16152-z,,35831470,WOS:000824883400120,View Full Record in Web of Science

Specifically, the relative effects of human-wildlife and wildlife-wildlife interactions on disease outbreaks among wildlife populations in urban and peri-urban environments remain unclear. We used social network analysis and epidemiological Susceptible-Infected-Recovered models to simulate zooanthroponotic outbreaks, through wild animals' joint propensities to co-interact with humans, and their social grooming of conspecifics. On 10 groups of macaques (Macaca spp.) in peri-urban environments in Asia, we collected behavioral data using event sampling of human-macaque interactions within the same time and space, and focal sampling of macaques' social interactions with conspecifics and overall anthropogenic exposure. Model-predicted outbreak sizes were related to structural features of macaques' networks. For all three species, and for both anthropogenic (co-interactions) and social (grooming) contexts, outbreak sizes were positively correlated to the network centrality of first-infected macaques. Across host species and contexts, the above effects were stronger through macaques' human co-interaction networks than through their grooming networks, particularly for rhesus and bonnet macaques. Long-tailed macaques appeared to show intraspecific variation in these effects. Our findings suggest that among wildlife in anthropogenically-impacted environments, the structure of their aggregations around anthropogenic factors makes them more vulnerable to zooanthroponotic outbreaks than their social structure. The global features of these networks that influence disease outbreaks, and their underlying socio-ecological covariates, need further investigation.

We analysed extracted relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs using random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regression models. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42016043164. Findings 19 837 records were identified from the search, of which 124 studies were included, providing 83 water (62 616 children), 20 sanitation (40 799 children), and 41 hygiene (98 416 children) comparisons. Compared with untreated water from an unimproved source, risk of diarrhoea was reduced by up to 50% with water treated at point of use (POU): filtration (n=23 studies; RR 0.50 [95% CI 0.41-0.60]), solar treatment (n=13; 0.63 [0.50-0.80]), and chlorination (n=25; 0.66 [0.56-0.77]). Compared with an unimproved source, provision of an improved drinking water supply on premises with higher water quality reduced diarrhoea risk by 52% (n=2; 0.48 [0.26-0.87]). Overall, sanitation interventions reduced diarrhoea risk by 24% (0.76 [0.61-0.94]). Compared with unimproved sanitation, providing sewer connection reduced diarrhoea risk by 47% (n=5; 0.53 [0.30-0.93]). Promotion of handwashing with soap reduced diarrhoea risk by 30% (0.70 [0.64-0.76]). Interpretation WASH interventions reduced risk of diarrhoea in children in LMICs. Interventions supplying either water filtered at POU, higher water quality from an improved source on premises, or basic sanitation services with sewer connection were associated with increased reductions. Our results support higher service levels called for under SDG 6. Notably, no studies evaluated interventions that delivered access to safely managed WASH services, the level of service to which universal coverage by 2030 is committed under the SDG.

We estimated 13.5 percent prevalence of diagnosed prediabetes in the overall US adult population, using national survey data.

The most effective intervention for diabetes prevention, known as the National Diabetes Prevention Program, remained woefully undersupplied and underused. There are only 2,098 National Diabetes Prevention Program-recognized providers nationally, and only 3 percent of adults with prediabetes have participated in the program.

This study proposes potential immunological biomarkers that could developed for predicting therapeutic response in patients with RCC. Methods Using flow cytometry, RNA sequencing, and T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing, we investigated changes in T cells in the peripheral blood of patients with advanced RCC after receiving immunotherapy. We used immunofluorescence (IF) imaging and flow cytometry to investigate how intratumoral T cells in patients' tumors (resected months/years prior to receiving checkpoint therapy) predicted patient outcomes after immunotherapy. Results We found that a small proportion of CD4 and CD8 T cells in the blood activate following checkpoint therapy, expressing the proliferation marker Ki67 and activation markers HLA-DR and CD38. Patients who had the highest increase in these HLA-DR +CD38+CD8 T cells after treatment had the best antitumor immune response and experienced clinical benefit. Using RNA sequencing, we found that while these cells expanded in most patients, their phenotype did not drastically change during treatment. However, when we analyzed the TCR repertoire of these HLA-DR +CD38+CD8+T cells, we found that only patients who clinically benefitted had a burst of new clonotypes enter this pool of activated cells. Finally, we found that abundant T cells in the untreated tumors predicted clinical benefit to checkpoint therapy on disease progression. Conclusions Together, these data suggest that having a strong pre-existing immune response and immediate peripheral T-cell activation after checkpoint therapy is a predictor of clinical benefit in patients with RCC.",JUL,2022,10,7,,,e004803,10.1136/jitc-2022-004803,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2022-004803,,35863822,WOS:000830477500005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Mandatory food fortification with folic acid is a safe, cost-effective, and sustainable intervention to prevent spina bifida and anencephaly. Yet few countries implement fortification with folic acid; only a quarter of all preventable spina bifida and anencephaly cases worldwide are currently avoided by food fortification. We summarise scientific evidence supporting immediate, mandatory fortification with folic acid to prevent the development of spina bifida and anencephaly. We make an urgent call to action for the World Health Assembly to pass a resolution for universal mandatory folic acid fortification. Such a resolution could accelerate the slow pace of spina bifida and anencephaly prevention globally, and will assist countries to reach their 2030 Sustainable Development Goals on child mortality and health equity.

Multiple trial designs, endpoints, and thresholds for non-inferiority have been used; however, no consensus or convention has ever been agreed to categorise biomarkers useful to inform the treatment intensity modulation of cancer treatments. Methods: An expert subgroup under the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Precision MedicineWorking Group shaped an international collaborative project to develop a classification system for biomarkers used in the cancer treatment de-intensification, based on a tiered approach. A group of disease-oriented clinical, translational, methodology and public health experts, and patients' representatives provided an analysis of the status quo, and scanned the horizon of ongoing clinical trials. The classification was developed through multiple rounds of expert revisions and inputs. Results: The working group agreed on a univocal definition of treatment de-intensification. Evidence of reduction in the dose-density, intensity, or cumulative dose, including intermittent schedules or shorter treatment duration or deletion of segment(s) of the standard regimens, compound(s), or treatment modality must be demonstrated, to define a treatment de-intensification. De-intensified regimens must also portend a positive impact on toxicity, quality of life, health system burden, or financial toxicity. ESMO classification categorises the biomarkers for treatment modulation in three tiers, based on the level of evidence. Tier A includes biomarkers validated in prospective, randomised, non-inferiority clinical trials. The working group agreed that in non-inferiority clinical trials, boundaries are highly dependent upon the disease scenario and endpoint being studied and that the absolute differences in the outcomes are the most relevant measures, rather than relative differences. Biomarkers tested in single-arm studies with a threshold of non-inferiority are classified as Tier B. Tier C is when the validation occurs in prospective-retrospective quality cohort investigations. Conclusions: ESMO classification for the risk-guided intensity modulation of cancer treatments provides a set of evidence-based criteria to categorise biomarkers deemed to inform de-intensification of cancer treatments, in riskdefined patients. The classification aims at harmonising definitions on this matter, therefore offering a common language for all the relevant stakeholders, including clinicians, patients, decision-makers, and for clinical trials.",JUL,2022,33,7,702,712,,10.1016/j.annonc.2022.03.273,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2022.03.273,,35550723,WOS:000814934800006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Together with interstitial fluid, CSF plays a critical role for the removal of waste products from the brain, and maintenance of the CNS health. As such, understanding the mechanisms driving CSF movement is of high scientific and clinical impact. Since pulsatile CSF dynamics is sensitive and synchronous to respiratory movements, we are interested in identifying potential integrative therapies such as yogic breathing to regulate CSF dynamics, which has not been reported before. Here, we investigated the pre-intervention baseline data from our ongoing randomized controlled trial, and examined the impact of four yogic breathing patterns: (i) slow, (ii) deep abdominal, (iii) deep diaphragmatic, and (iv) deep chest breathing with the last three together forming a yogic breathing called three-part breath. We utilized our previously established non-invasive real-time phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging approach using a 3T MRI instrument, computed and tested differences in single voxel CSF velocities (instantaneous, respiratory, cardiac 1st and 2nd harmonics) at the level of foramen magnum during spontaneous versus yogic breathing. In examinations of 18 healthy participants (eight females, ten males; mean age 34.9 +/- 14 (SD) years; age range: 18-61 years), we observed immediate increase in cranially-directed velocities of instantaneous-CSF 16-28% and respiratory-CSF 60-118% during four breathing patterns compared to spontaneous breathing, with the greatest changes during deep abdominal breathing (28%, p = 0.0008, and 118%, p = 0.0001, respectively). Cardiac pulsation was the primary source of pulsatile CSF motion except during deep abdominal breathing, when there was a comparable contribution of respiratory and cardiac 1st harmonic power [0.59 +/- 0.78], suggesting respiration can be the primary regulator of CSF depending on the individual differences in breathing techniques. Further work is needed to investigate the impact of sustained training yogic breathing on pulsatile CSF dynamics for CNS health.",JUN 28,2022,12,1,,,10894,10.1038/s41598-022-15034-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-15034-8,,35764793,WOS:000819039200008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Transplacental transfer of antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) after maternal Covid-19 vaccination may confer protection against Covid-19 in infants. METHODS We used a case-control test-negative design to assess the effectiveness of maternal vaccination during pregnancy against hospitalization for Covid-19 among infants younger than 6 months of age. Between July 1, 2021, and March 8, 2022, we enrolled infants hospitalized for Covid-19 (case infants) and infants hospitalized without Covid-19 (control infants) at 30 hospitals in 22 states. We estimated vaccine effectiveness by comparing the odds of full maternal vaccination (two doses of mRNA vaccine) among case infants and control infants during circulation of the B.1.617.2 (delta) variant (July 1, 2021, to December 18, 2021) and the B.1.1.259 (omicron) variant (December 19, 2021, to March 8, 2022). RESULTS A total of 537 case infants (181 of whom had been admitted to a hospital during the delta period and 356 during the omicron period; median age, 2 months) and 512 control infants were enrolled and included in the analyses; 16% of the case infants and 29% of the control infants had been born to mothers who had been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 during pregnancy. Among the case infants, 113 (21%) received intensive care (64 [12%] received mechanical ventilation or vasoactive infusions). Two case infants died from Covid-19; neither infant's mother had been vaccinated during pregnancy. The effectiveness of maternal vaccination against hospitalization for Covid-19 among infants was 52% (95% confidence interval [CI], 33 to 65) overall, 80% (95% CI, 60 to 90) during the delta period, and 38% (95% CI, 8 to 58) during the omicron period. Effectiveness was 69% (95% CI, 50 to 80) when maternal vaccination occurred after 20 weeks of pregnancy and 38% (95% CI, 3 to 60) during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy.

Similar to cervical cancer, anal cancer is preceded by high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs). Treatment for cervical HSIL reduces progression to cervical cancer; however, data from prospective studies of treatment for anal HSIL to prevent anal cancer are lacking. Methods We conducted a phase 3 trial at 25 U.S. sites. Persons living with HIV who were 35 years of age or older and who had biopsy-proven anal HSIL were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either HSIL treatment or active monitoring without treatment. Treatment included office-based ablative procedures, ablation or excision under anesthesia, or the administration of topical fluorouracil or imiquimod. The primary outcome was progression to anal cancer in a time-to-event analysis. Participants in the treatment group were treated until HSIL was completely resolved. All the participants underwent high-resolution anoscopy at least every 6 months; biopsy was also performed for suspected ongoing HSIL in the treatment group, annually in the active-monitoring group, or any time there was concern for cancer. Results Of 4459 participants who underwent randomization, 4446 (99.7%) were included in the analysis of the time to progression to cancer. With a median follow-up of 25.8 months, 9 cases were diagnosed in the treatment group (173 per 100,000 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 90 to 332) and 21 cases in the active-monitoring group (402 per 100,000 person-years; 95% CI, 262 to 616). The rate of progression to anal cancer was lower in the treatment group than in the active-monitoring group by 57% (95% CI, 6 to 80; P=0.03 by log-rank test).

Background Because PVCs can signal myocardial irritability, in-hospital electrocardiographic (ECG) monitors are typically configured to alert nurses when they occur. However, PVC alarms are common and can contribute to alarm fatigue. A better understanding of occurrences of PVCs could help guide alarm management strategies. Design A secondary quantitative analysis from an alarm study. Methods The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist was followed. Seven PVC alarm types (vendor-specific) were described, and included isolated, couplet, bigeminy, trigeminy, run PVC (i.e. VT >2), R-on-T and PVCs/min. Negative binomial and hurdle regression analyses were computed to examine the association of patient demographic and clinical characteristics with each PVC type. Results A total of 797,072 PVC alarms (45,271 monitoring hours) occurred in 446 patients, including six who had disproportionately high PVC alarm counts (40% of the total alarms). Isolated PVCs were the most frequent type (81.13%) while R-on-T were the least common (0.29%). Significant predictors associated with higher alarms rates: older age (isolated PVCs, bigeminy and couplets); male sex and presence of PVCs on the 12-lead ECG (isolated PVCs). Hyperkalaemia at ICU admission was associated with a lower R-on-T type PVCs. Conclusions Only a few distinct demographic and clinical characteristics were associated with the occurrence rate of PVC alarms. Further research is warranted to examine whether PVCs were associated with adverse outcomes, which could guide alarm management strategies to reduce unnecessary PVC alarms. Relevance to clinical practice Targeted alarm strategies, such as turning off certain PVC-type alarms and evaluating alarm trends in the first 24 h of admission in select patients, might add to the current practice of alarm management.",,,,,,,,10.1111/jocn.16408,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jocn.16408,JUN 2022,35712789,WOS:000811978000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

While these findings may eventually lead to new therapeutic opportunities, little is known about how these glial responses are reflected by biomarker changes in bodily fluids. Such knowledge, however, appears crucial for patient stratification, as well as monitoring disease progression and treatment responses in clinical trials. Here, we took advantage of well-described mouse models of beta-amyloidosis and alpha-synucleinopathy to explore cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome changes related to their respective proteopathic lesions. Nontargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that the majority of proteins that undergo age-related changes in CSF of either mouse model were linked to microglia and astrocytes. Specifically, we identified a panel of more than 20 glial-derived proteins that were increased in CSF of aged beta-amyloid precursor protein- and alpha-synuclein-transgenic mice and largely overlap with previously described disease-associated glial genes identified by single-cell transcriptomics. Our results also show that enhanced shedding is responsible for the increase of several of the identified glial CSF proteins as exemplified for TREM2. Notably, the vast majority of these proteins can also be quantified in human CSF and reveal changes in Alzheimer's disease cohorts. The finding that cellular transcriptome changes translate into corresponding changes of CSF proteins is of clinical relevance, supporting efforts to identify fluid biomarkers that reflect the various functional states of glial responses in cerebral proteopathies, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.",JUN 14,2022,119,24,,,e2119804119,10.1073/pnas.2119804119,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2119804119,,35666874,WOS:000839335700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The behavior of neuronal networks, including functional connectivity and induced connectivity changes by external stimuli, can be studied using models of cultured neurons. Cultured neurons tend to be active in groups, and pairs of neurons are said to be functionally connected when their firing patterns show significant synchronicity. Methods to infer functional connections are often based on pair-wise cross-correlation between activity patterns of (small groups of) neurons. However, these methods are not very sensitive to detect inhibitory connections, and they were not designed for use during stimulation. Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) models may provide a conceptually different method to infer functional connectivity. They have the potential benefit to estimate functional connectivity during stimulation, and to infer excitatory as well as inhibitory connections. MaxEnt models do not involve pairwise comparison, but aim to capture probability distributions of sets of neurons that are synchronously active in discrete time bins. We used electrophysiological recordings from in vitro neuronal cultures on micro electrode arrays to investigate the ability of MaxEnt models to infer functional connectivity. Connectivity estimates provided by MaxEnt models correlated well with those obtained by conditional firing probabilities (CFP), an established cross-correlation based method. In addition, stimulus-induced connectivity changes were detected by MaxEnt models, and were of the same magnitude as those detected by CFP. Thus, MaxEnt models provide a potentially powerful new tool to study functional connectivity in neuronal networks.",JUN 10,2022,12,1,,,9656,10.1038/s41598-022-13674-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-13674-4,,35688933,WOS:000809441100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Alterations in lysosomal metabolism are implicated in ageing-associated metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. However, how lysosomal metabolism actively coordinates the metabolic and nervous systems to regulate ageing remains unclear. Here we report a fat-to-neuron lipid signalling pathway induced by lysosomal metabolism and its longevity-promoting role in Caenorhabditis elegans. We discovered that induced lysosomal lipolysis in peripheral fat storage tissue upregulates the neuropeptide signalling pathway in the nervous system to promote longevity. This cell-non-autonomous regulation is mediated by a specific polyunsaturated fatty acid, dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid, and LBP-3 lipid chaperone protein transported from the fat storage tissue to neurons. LBP-3 binds to dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid, and acts through NHR-49 nuclear receptor and NLP-11 neuropeptide in neurons to extend lifespan.

The identification of biomarkers may improve outcome prediction among individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR-P). OBJECTIVE To examine whether mismatch negativity (MMN) event-related potential amplitude, which is deficient in schizophrenia, is reduced in young people with the CHR-P syndrome and associated with outcomes, accounting for effects of antipsychotic medication use. DESIGN, SETTING. AND PARTICIPANTS MMN data were collected as part of the multisite case-control North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS-2) from 8 university-based outpatient research programs. Baseline MMN data were collected from June 2009 through April 2013. Clinical outcomes were assessed throughout 24 months. Participants were individuals with the CHR-P syndrome and healthy controls with MMN data. Participants with the CHR-P syndrome who developed psychosis (ie, converters) were compared with those who did not develop psychosis (ie, nonconverters) who were followed up for 24 months. Analysis took place between December 2019 and December 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Electroencephalography was recorded during a passive auditory oddball paradigm. MMN elicited by duration-, pitch-, and duration + pitch double-deviant tones was measured. RESULTS The CHR-P group (n = 580; mean [SD] age, 19.24 [4.39] years) included 247 female individuals (42.6%) and the healthy control group (n = 241; mean age, 20.33 [4.74] years) included 114 female individuals (47.3%). In the CHR-P group, 450 (77.6%) were not taking antipsychotic medication at baseline. Baseline MMN amplitudes, irrespective of deviant type, were deficient in future CHR-P converters to psychosis (n = 77, unmedicated n = 54) compared with nonconverters (n = 238, unmedicated n = 190) in both the full sample (d = 0.27) and the unmedicated subsample (d = 0.33). In the full sample, baseline medication status interacted with group and deviant type indicating that double-deviant MMN, compared with single deviants, was reduced in unmedicated converters compared with nonconverters (d = 0.43). Further, within the unmedicated subsample, deficits in double-deviant MMN were most strongly associated with earlier conversion to psychosis (hazard ratio, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.03-1.90]; P = .03], which persisted over and above positive symptom severity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study found that MMN amplitude deficits were sensitive to future psychosis conversion among individuals at risk of CHR-P, particularly those not taking antipsychotic medication at baseline, although associations were modest. While MMN shows limited promise as a biomarker of psychosis onset on its own, it may contribute novel risk information to multivariate prediction algorithms and serve as a translational neurophysiological target for novel treatment development in a subgroup of at-risk individuals.",AUG,2022,79,8,780,789,,10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2022.1417,http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2022.1417,JUN 2022,35675082,WOS:000809216200004,View Full Record in Web of Science

OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether electronic symptom monitoring during cancer treatment confers benefits on quality-of-life outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Report of secondary outcomes from the PRO-TECT (Alliance AFT-39) cluster randomized trial in 52 US community oncology practices randomized to electronic symptom monitoring with PRO surveys or usual care. Between October 2017 and March 2020, 1191 adults being treated formetastatic cancer were enrolled, with last follow-up on May 17, 2021. INTERVENTIONS In the PRO group, participants (n = 593) were asked to complete weekly surveys via an internet-based or automated telephone system for up to 1 year. Severe or worsening symptoms triggered care team alerts. The control group (n = 598) received usual care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The 3 prespecified secondary outcomeswere physical function, symptom control, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) at 3 months, measured by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30; range, 0-100 points; minimum clinically important difference [MCID], 2-7 for physical function; no MCID defined for symptom control or HRQOL). Results on the primary outcome, overall survival, are not yet available. RESULTS Among 52 practices, 1191 patients were included (mean age, 62.2 years; 694 [58.3%] women); 1066 (89.5%) completed 3-month follow-up. Compared with usual care, mean changes on the QLQ-C30 from baseline to 3 months were significantly improved in the PRO group for physical function (PRO, from 74.27 to 75.81 points; control, from 73.54 to 72.61 points; mean difference, 2.47 [95% CI, 0.41-4.53]; P =.02), symptom control (PRO, from 77.67 to 80.03 points; control, from 76.75 to 76.55 points; mean difference, 2.56 [95% CI, 0.95-4.17]; P =.002), and HRQOL (PRO, from 78.11 to 80.03 points; control, from 77.00 to 76.50 points; mean difference, 2.43 [95% CI, 0.90-3.96]; P =.002). Patients in the PRO group had significantly greater odds of experiencing clinically meaningful benefits vs usual care for physical function (7.7% more with improvements of >= 5 points and 6.1% fewer with worsening of >= 5 points; odds ratio [OR], 1.35 [95% CI, 1.08-1.70]; P =.009), symptom control (8.6% and 7.5%, respectively; OR, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.15-1.95]; P =.003), and HRQOL (8.5% and 4.9%, respectively; OR, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.10-1.81]; P =.006). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this report of secondary outcomes from a randomized clinical trial of adults receiving cancer treatment, use of weekly electronic PRO surveys to monitor symptoms, compared with usual care, resulted in statistically significant improvements in physical function, symptom control, and HRQOL at 3 months, with mean improvements of approximately 2.5 points on a 0- to 100-point scale.

In the phase 1 dose-defining portion of the study, teclistamab showed promising efficacy in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. METHODS In this phase 1-2 study, we enrolled patients who had relapsed or refractory myeloma after at least three therapy lines, including triple-class exposure to an immunomodulatory drug, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 antibody. Patients received a weekly subcutaneous injection of teclistamab (at a dose of 1.5 mg per kilogram of body weight) after receiving step-up doses of 0.06 mg and 0.3 mg per kilogram. The primary end point was the overall response (partial response or better). RESULTS Among 165 patients who received teclistamab, 77.8% had triple-class refractory disease (median, five previous therapy lines). With a median follow-up of 14.1 months, the overall response rate was 63.0%, with 65 patients (39.4%) having a complete response or better. A total of 44 patients (26.7%) were found to have no minimal residual disease (MRD); the MRD-negativity rate among the patients with a complete response or better was 46%. The median duration of response was 18.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.9 to not estimable). The median duration of progression-free survival was 11.3 months (95% CI, 8.8 to 17.1). Common adverse events included cytokine release syndrome (in 72.1% of the patients; grade 3, 0.6%; no grade 4), neutropenia (in 70.9%; grade 3 or 4, 64.2%), anemia (in 52.1%; grade 3 or 4, 37.0%), and thrombocytopenia (in 40.0%; grade 3 or 4, 21.2%). Infections were frequent (in 76.4%; grade 3 or 4, 44.8%). Neurotoxic events occurred in 24 patients (14.5%), including immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome in 5 patients (3.0%; all grade 1 or 2).

METHODS In this phase 3 trial, adults (18 to 65 years of age) with symptomatic myeloma received one cycle of RVD. We randomly assigned these patients, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive two additional RVD cycles plus stem-cell mobilization, followed by either five additional RVD cycles (the RVD-alone group) or high-dose melphalan plus ASCT followed by two additional RVD cycles (the transplantation group). Both groups received lenalidomide until disease progression, unacceptable side effects, or both. The primary end point was progression-free survival. RESULTS Among 357 patients in the RVD-alone group and 365 in the transplantation group, at a median follow-up of 76.0 months, 328 events of disease progression or death occurred; the risk was 53% higher in the RVD-alone group than in the transplantation group (hazard ratio, 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23 to 1.91; P < 0.001); median progression-free survival was 46.2 months and 67.5 months. The percentage of patients with a partial response or better was 95.0% in the RVD-alone group and 97.5% in the transplantation group (P=0.55); 42.0% and 46.8%, respectively, had a complete response or better (P=0.99).

Here we develop an approach based on multispectral deep-ultraviolet (UV) microscopy that provides novel quantitative insight into the aggressiveness and grade of this disease, thus providing a new tool to help address this important challenge. We find that UV spectral signatures from endogenous molecules give rise to a phenotypical continuum that provides unique structural insight (i.e., molecular maps or optical stains) of thin tissue sections with subcellular (nanoscale) resolution. We show that this phenotypical continuum can also be applied as a surrogate biomarker of prostate cancer malignancy, where patients with the most aggressive tumors show a ubiquitous glandular phenotypical shift. In addition to providing several novel optical stains with contrast for disease, we also adapt a two-part Cycle-consistent Generative Adversarial Network to translate the label-free deep-UV images into virtual hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained images, thus providing multiple stains (including the gold-standard H&E) from the same unlabeled specimen. Agreement between the virtual H&E images and the H&E-stained tissue sections is evaluated by a panel of pathologists who find that the two modalities are in excellent agreement. This work has significant implications towards improving our ability to objectively quantify prostate cancer grade and aggressiveness, thus improving the management and clinical outcomes of prostate cancer patients. This same approach can also be applied broadly in other tumor types to achieve low-cost, stain-free, quantitative histopathological analysis.",JUN 4,2022,12,1,,,9329,10.1038/s41598-022-13332-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-13332-9,,35665770,WOS:000806660800022,View Full Record in Web of Science

We report that intracellular PLA2G7 is selectively important for cell proliferation and tumor growth potential of melanoma cells expressing mutant NRAS, but not cells expressing BRAF V600E. Mechanistically, PLA2G7 signals through its product Lyso-PAF to contribute to RAF1 activation by mutant NRAS, which is bypassed by BRAF V600E. Intracellular Lyso-PAF promotes p21-activated kinase 2 (PAK2) activation by binding to its catalytic domain and altering ATP kinetics, while PAK2 significantly contributes to S338-phosphorylation of RAF1 in addition to PAK1. Furthermore, the PLA2G7-PAK2 axis is also required for full activation of RAF1 in cells stimulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) or cancer cells expressing mutant KRAS.

METHODS An updated literature search identified randomized clinical trials and prospective-retrospective studies published from January 2016 to October 2021. Outcomes of interest included overall survival and disease-free or recurrence-free survival. Expert Panel members used informal consensus to develop evidence-based recommendations. RESULTS The search identified 24 studies informing the evidence base. RECOMMENDATIONS Clinicians may use Oncotype DX, MammaPrint, Breast Cancer Index (BCI), and EndoPredict to guide adjuvant endocrine and chemotherapy in patients who are postmenopausal or age > 50 years with early-stage estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative (ER+ and HER2-) breast cancer that is node-negative or with 1-3 positive nodes. Prosigna and BCI may be used in postmenopausal patients with node-negative ER+ and HER2- breast cancer. In premenopausal patients, clinicians may use Oncotype in patients with node-negative ER+ and HER2- breast cancer. Current data suggest that premenopausal patients with 1-3 positive nodes benefit from chemotherapy regardless of genomic assay result. There are no data on use of genomic tests to guide adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with >= 4 positive nodes. Ki67 combined with other parameters or immunohistochemistry 4 score may be used in postmenopausal patients without access to genomic tests to guide adjuvant therapy decisions. BCI may be offered to patients with 0-3 positive nodes who received 5 years of endocrine therapy without evidence of recurrence to guide decisions about extended endocrine therapy. None of the assays are recommended for treatment guidance in individuals with HER2-positive or triple-negative breast cancer.

The latter finding suggests that dietary emulsifiers impact brain areas that modulate stress responses. The goal of the current study was to test whether emulsifier consumption is associated with changes in gene expression in the amygdala and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), two brain areas that are involved in behavioral and neuroendocrine responses to stress. Using RNA-Seq, we compared groups consuming either carboxymethylcellulose or polysorbate 80 for 12-weeks. A total of 243 genes were differentially expressed in the amygdala and PVN of emulsifier-treated mice compared to controls. There was minimal overlap of differentially expressed genes in CMC- and P80-treated animals, suggesting that each emulsifier acts via distinct molecular mechanisms to produce an anxiety-like phenotype. Furthermore, gene ontology and pathway analysis revealed that various stress, metabolic, and immune terms and pathways were altered by emulsifiers. These findings are the first to demonstrate that emulsifier consumption changes gene expression in brain regions that are critical for stress responding, providing possible molecular mechanisms that may underly the previously observed anxiety-like phenotype.",JUN 1,2022,12,1,,,9146,10.1038/s41598-022-13021-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-13021-7,,35650224,WOS:000804787700025,View Full Record in Web of Science

The objective of this study was to determine impact of day-to-day intraindividual pain variability on patient outcomes in SCD. We calculated metrics of pain variability and pain intensity for 139 participants with <10% missing data in the first 28 days of the Pain in Sickle Cell Epidemiology Study. We performed Spearman rank correlations between measures of intraindividual pain variability and outcomes. We then used k-means clustering to identify phenotypes of pain in SCD. We found that pain variability was inversely correlated with health-related quality of life, except in those with daily or near-daily pain. Pain variability was positively correlated with affective coping, catastrophizing, somatic symptom burden, sickle cell stress, health care utilization, and opioid use. We found 3 subgroups or clusters of pain phenotypes in SCD. Cluster 1 included individuals with the lowest mean pain, lowest temporal instability and dependency, lowest proportion of days with pain and opioid use, and highest physical function. Cluster 2 included individuals with the highest mean pain, highest temporal dependency, highest proportion of days with pain and opioid use, and lowest physical function. Cluster 3 included individuals with high levels of mean pain, highest temporal instability, but with lower temporal dependency, proportion of days with pain and opioid use, and physical function compared with cluster 2.

Design: Serial survey and serologic testing at 2 time points with 3-month interval exposure assessment. Setting and Participants: Fourteen nursing homes in the state of Georgia; 203 contracted or employed staff members from those 14 participating nursing homes who were seronegative at the first time point and provided a serology specimen at second time point, at which time they reported no COVID-19 vaccination or only very recent vaccination (<= 4 weeks). Methods: Interval infection was defined as seroconversion to antibody presence for both nucleocapsid protein and spike protein. We estimated adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% CIs by job type, using multivariable logistic regression, accounting for community-based risks including interval community incidence and interval change in resident infections per bed. Results: Among 203 eligible staff, 72 (35.5%) had evidence of interval infection. In multivariable analysis among unvaccinated staff, staff SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced seroconversion was significantly higher among nurses and certified nursing assistants accounting for race and interval infection incidence in both the community and facility (aOR 5.3, 95% CI 1.0-28.4). This risk persisted but was attenuated when using the full study cohort including those with very recent vaccination. Conclusions and Implications: Midway through the first year of the pandemic, job type continues to be associated with increased risk for infection despite enhanced infection prevention efforts including routine screening of staff. These results suggest that mitigation strategies prior to vaccination did not eliminate occupational risk for infection and emphasize critical need to maximize vaccine utilization to eliminate excess risk among front-line providers.

An assessment of authorship representation in the global emergency medicine (GEM) literature is lacking but may inform equitable academic collaborations in this relatively new field. Methods We conducted a bibliometric analysis of original research articles reporting studies conducted in LMICs from the annual GEM Literature Review from 2016 to 2020. Data extracted included study topic, journal, study country(s) and region, country income classification, author order, country(s) of authors' affiliations and funding sources. We compared the proportion of authors affiliated with each income bracket using X-2 analysis. We conducted logistic regression to identify factors associated with first or last authorship affiliated with the study country. Results There were 14 113 authors in 1751 articles. Nearly half (45.5%) of the articles reported work conducted in lower middle-income countries (MICs), 23.6% in upper MICs, 22.5% in low-income countries (LICs). Authors affiliated with HICs were most represented (40.7%); 26.4% were affiliated with lower MICs, 17.4% with upper MICs, 10.3% with LICs and 5.1% with mixed affiliations. Among single-country studies, those without any local authors (8.7%) were most common among those conducted in LICs (14.4%). Only 31.0% of first authors and 21.3% of last authors were affiliated with LIC study countries. Studies in upper MICs (adjusted OR (aOR) 3.6, 95% CI 2.46 to 5.26) and those funded by the study country (aOR 2.94, 95% CI 2.05 to 4.20) had greater odds of having a local first author. Conclusions There were significant disparities in authorship representation. Authors affiliated with HICs more commonly occupied the most prominent authorship positions.

We aimed to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the ability of AI to recognise a patient's racial identity from medical images. Methods Using private (Emory CXR, Emory Chest CT, Emory Cervical Spine, and Emory Mammogram) and public (MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert, National Lung Cancer Screening Trial, RSNA Pulmonary Embolism CT, and Digital Hand Atlas) datasets, we evaluated, first, performance quantification of deep learning models in detecting race from medical images, including the ability of these models to generalise to external environments and across multiple imaging modalities. Second, we assessed possible confounding of anatomic and phenotypic population features by assessing the ability of these hypothesised confounders to detect race in isolation using regression models, and by re-evaluating the deep learning models by testing them on datasets stratified by these hypothesised confounding variables. Last, by exploring the effect of image corruptions on model performance, we investigated the underlying mechanism by which AI models can recognise race. Findings In our study, we show that standard AI deep learning models can be trained to predict race from medical images with high performance across multiple imaging modalities, which was sustained under external validation conditions (x-ray imaging [area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) range 0.91-0-99], CT chest imaging [0.87-0-96], and mammography [0.81]). We also showed that this detection is not due to proxies or imaging-related surrogate covariates for race (eg, performance of possible confounders: body-mass index [AUC 0.55], disease distribution [0.61], and breast density [0.61]). Finally, we provide evidence to show that the ability of AI deep learning models persisted over all anatomical regions and frequency spectrums of the images, suggesting the efforts to control this behaviour when it is undesirable will be challenging and demand further study. Interpretation The results from our study emphasise that the ability of AI deep learning models to predict self-reported race is itself not the issue of importance. However, our finding that AI can accurately predict self-reported race, even from corrupted, cropped, and noised medical images, often when clinical experts cannot, creates an enormous risk for all model deployments in medical imaging.

Immune-based approaches have begun to transform the therapeutic landscape in children with B-ALL. Recent studies identified several alterations in both innate and adaptive immune cells in children with B-ALL that may impact disease risk and outcome. However, the impact of racial/ethnic background on immune microenvironment is less studied, as children of minorities background have to date been severely under-represented in such studies. Methods We performed high-dimensional analysis of bone marrow from 85 children with newly diagnosed B-ALL (Hispanic=29, black=18, NHW=38) using mass cytometry with 40 and 38-marker panels. Results Race/ethnicity-associated differences were most prominent in the innate immune compartment. Hispanic patients had significantly increased proportion of distinct mature CD57 +T-bet+DR+ NK cells compared with other cohorts. These differences were most apparent within standard risk (SR) patients with Hispanic SR patients having greater numbers of CD57 +NK cells compared with other cohorts (43% vs 26% p=0.0049). Hispanic and Black children also had distinct alterations in myeloid cells, with a significant increase in a population of non-classical activated HLA-DR +CD16+myeloid cells, previously implicated in disease progression, compared with NHW counterparts. Racial background also correlated with altered expression of inhibitory checkpoint PD-L1 on myeloid cells. Conclusion There are surprisingly substantial race/ethnicity-based differences in innate immune cells of children with newly diagnosed B-ALL.

Acinetobacter baumannii is increasingly refractory to antibiotic treatment in healthcare settings. As is true of most human pathogens, the genetic path to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and the role that the immune system plays in modulating AMR during disease are poorly understood. Here we reproduced several routes to fluoroquinolone resistance, performing evolution experiments using sequential lung infections in mice that are replete with or depleted of neutrophils, providing two key insights into the evolution of drug resistance. First, neutropenic hosts acted as reservoirs for the accumulation of drug resistance during drug treatment. Selection for variants with altered drug sensitivity profiles arose readily in the absence of neutrophils, while immunocompetent animals restricted the appearance of these variants. Secondly, antibiotic treatment failure in the immunocompromised host was shown to occur without clinically defined resistance, an unexpected result that provides a model for how antibiotic failure occurs clinically in the absence of AMR. The genetic mechanism underlying both these results is initiated by mutations activating the drug egress pump regulator AdeL, which drives persistence in the presence of antibiotic. Therefore, antibiotic persistence mutations present a two-pronged risk during disease, causing drug treatment failure in the immunocompromised host while simultaneously increasing the emergence of high-level AMR.",JUN,2022,7,6,796,+,,10.1038/s41564-022-01126-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41564-022-01126-8,,35618774,WOS:000804858100010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Structural racism negatively impacts individuals and populations. In the medical literature, including that of palliative care, structural racism's influence on interracial differences in outcomes remains poorly examined. Examining the contribution of structural racism to outcomes is paramount to promoting equity. Objectives. We examined portrayals of race and racial differences in outcomes in the palliative care literature and created a framework using critical race theory (CRT) to aid in this examination. Methods. We reviewed the CRT literature and iteratively developed a rubric to examine when and how differences between races are described. Research articles published in The Journal of Pain and Symptom Management presenting empiric data specifically including findings about racial differences were examined independently by three reviewers using the rubric. Results. Fifty-seven articles met inclusion criteria. Articles that specifically described racial differences were common in the topic areas of quality (75% of articles), hospice (53%), palliative care services (40%) and spirituality/religion (40%). The top three reasons posited for racial differences were patient preference (26%), physician bias (23%), and cultural barriers (21%). Using the CRT rubric we found that 65% of articles posited that a racial difference was something that needed to be rectified, while articles rarely provided narrative (5%) or other data on perspectives of people of color (11%) to explain assumptions about differences. Conclusion. Palliative care research frequently highlights racial differences in outcomes. Articles that examine racial differences often assume that differences need to be fixed but posit reasons for differences without the narratives of those most affected by them.

Research and practice in critical care medicine have long been defined by syndromes, which, despite being clinically recognizable entities, are, in fact, loose amalgams of heterogeneous states that may respond differently to therapy. Mounting translational evidence-supported by research on respiratory failure due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection-suggests that the current syndrome-based framework of critical illness should be reconsidered. Here we discuss recent findings from basic science and clinical research in critical care and explore how these might inform a new conceptual model of critical illness.

Despite its potential clinical relevance, the TCR repertoire in peripheral blood has not been thoroughly explored for its value as an immunotherapy efficacy biomarker in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The purpose of the present study is to characterize and compare the TCR repertoire in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with HNSCC treated with the combination of cetuximab and nivolumab. Methods We used the immunoSEQ assay to sequence the TCR beta (TCR-B) chain repertoire from serially obtained PBMC at baseline and during the treatments from a total of 41 patients who received the combination (NCT03370276). Key TCR repertoire metrics, including diversity and clonality, were calculated and compared between patients with different therapy responses and clinical characteristics (eg, human papillomavirus (HPV) status and smoking history). Patient survival outcomes were compared according to patient groups stratified by the TCR-B clonotyping. To confirm the observed patterns in TCR spectrum, samples from patients who achieved complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) were further profiled with the immunoSEQ deep resolution assay. Results Our data indicated that the patients who achieved CR and PR had an increased TCR sequence diversity in their baseline samples, this tendency being more pronounced in HPV-negative patients or those with a smoking history. Notably, the CR/PR group had the lowest proportion of patients with oligoclonal TCR clones (2 out of 8 patients), followed by the stable disease group (9 out of 20 patients) and lastly the progressive disease group (7 out of 10 patients). An overall trend toward favorable patient survival was also observed in the polyclonal group. Finally, we reported the shared TCR clones across patients within the same response group, as well as the shared clones by aligning immunoSEQ reads with TCR data retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas- head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (TCGA-HNSC) cohort. Conclusions Our data suggest that, despite the great clinical heterogeneity of HNSCC and the limited responders in the present cohort, the peripheral TCR repertoires from pretreatment PBMC may be developed as biomarkers for the benefit of immunotherapy in HNSCC.",JUN,2022,10,6,,,e004512,10.1136/jitc-2022-004512,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2022-004512,,35676062,WOS:000811737500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Models with high sensitivity and specificity would enable programs to target more elaborate screening efforts to high-risk populations, while minimizing overtreatment for the rest. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based risk models have demonstrated a significant advance over risk models used today in clinical practice. However, the responsible deployment of novel AI requires careful validation across diverse populations. To this end, we validate our AI-based model, Mirai, across globally diverse screening populations. METHODS We collected screening mammograms and pathology-confirmed breast cancer outcomes from Massachusetts General Hospital, USA; Novant, USA; Emory, USA; Maccabi-Assuta, Israel; Karolinska, Sweden; Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taiwan; and Barretos, Brazil. We evaluated Uno's concordance index for Mirai in predicting risk of breast cancer at one to five years from the mammogram. RESULTS A total of 128,793 mammograms from 62,185 patients were collected across the seven sites, of which 3,815 were followed by a cancer diagnosis within 5 years. Mirai obtained concordance indices of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.78), 0.75 (95% CI, 0.70 to 0.80), 0.77 (95% CI, 0.75 to 0.79), 0.77 (95% CI, 0.73 to 0.81), 0.81 (95% CI, 0.79 to 0.82), 0.79 (95% CI, 0.76 to 0.83), and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.81 to 0.88) at Massachusetts General Hospital, Novant, Emory, Maccabi-Assuta, Karolinska, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, and Barretos, respectively.

To date, there are few robust estimates of this parameter for natural populations, and it is therefore unclear whether adaptive evolution can play a meaningful role in short-term population dynamics. We developed and applied quantitative genetic methods to long-term datasets from 19 wild bird and mammal populations and found that, while estimates vary between populations, additive genetic variance in relative fitness is often substantial and, on average, twice that of previous estimates.

Furthermore, tumours frequently escape T cell-mediated immunity through mechanisms that interfere with peptide presentation(1). Here we report a cancer vaccine that induces a coordinated attack by diverse T cell and natural killer (NK) cell populations. The vaccine targets the MICA and MICB (MICA/B) stress proteins expressed by many human cancers as a result of DNA damage(2). MICA/B serve as ligands for the activating NKG2D receptor on T cells and NK cells, but tumours evade immune recognition by proteolytic MICA/B cleavage(3,4). Vaccine-induced antibodies increase the density of MICA/B proteins on the surface of tumour cells by inhibiting proteolytic shedding, enhance presentation of tumour antigens by dendritic cells to T cells and augment the cytotoxic function of NK cells. Notably, this vaccine maintains efficacy against MHC class I-deficient tumours resistant to cytotoxic T cells through the coordinated action of NK cells and CD4(+) T cells. The vaccine is also efficacious in a clinically important setting: immunization following surgical removal of primary, highly metastatic tumours inhibits the later outgrowth of metastases.

A three-group randomised trial was designed to determine whether incremental gains in patient outcomes can be achieved by adding either 4-6 months of short-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to PBRT, or both short-term ADT and pelvic lymph node radiotherapy (PLNRT) to PBRT. Methods The international, multicentre, randomised, controlled SPPORT trial was done at 283 radiation oncology cancer treatment centres in the USA, Canada, and Israel. Eligible patients (aged >= 18 years) were those who after prostatectomy for adenocarcinoma of the prostate had a persistently detectable or an initially undetectable and rising PSA of between 0.1 and 2.0 ng/mL. Patients with and without lymphadenectomy (N0/Nx) were eligible if there was no clinical or pathological evidence of lymph node involvement. Other eligibility criteria included pT2 or pT3 disease, prostatectomy Gleason score of 9 or less, and a Zubrod performance status of 0-1. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive PBRT alone at a dose of 64.8-70.2 Gy at 1.8 Gy per fraction daily (group 1), PBRT plus short-term ADT (group 2), or PLNRT (45 Gy at 1.8 Gy per fraction, and then a volume reduction made to the planning target volume for the remaining 19.8-25 .2 Gy) plus PBRT plus short-term ADT (group 3). The primary endpoint was freedom from progression, in which progression was defined as biochemical failure according to the Phoenix definition (PSA >= 2 ng/mL over the nadir PSA), clinical failure (local, regional, or distant), or death from any cause. A planned interim analysis of 1191 patents with minimum potential follow-up time of 5 years applied a Haybittle-Peto boundary of p<0.001 (one sided) for comparison of 5-year freedom from progression rates between the treatment groups. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00567580. The primary objectives of the trial have been completed, although long-term follow-up is continuing. Findings Between March 31, 2008, and March 30, 2015, 1792 eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the three treatment groups (592 to group 1 [PBRT alone], 602 to group 2 [PBRT plus short-term ADT], and 598 to group 3 [PLNRT plus PBRT plus short-term ADT]). 76 patients subsequently found to be ineligible were excluded from the analyses; thus, the evaluable patient population comprised 1716 patients. At the interim analysis (n=1191 patients; data cutoff May 23, 2018), the Haybittle-Peto boundary for 5-year freedom from progression was exceeded when group 1 was compared with group 3 (difference 17.9%, SE 2.9%; p<0.0001). The difference between groups 2 and 3 did not exceed the boundary (p=0.0063). With additional follow-up beyond the interim analysis (the final planned analysis; data cutoff May 26, 2021), at a median follow-up among survivors of 8.2 years (IQR 6.6-9.4), the 5-year freedom from progression rates in all 1716 eligible patients were 70.9% (95% CI 67.0-74.9) in group 1, 81.3% (78.0-84.6) in group 2, and 87.4% (84.7-90.2) in group 3. Per protocol criteria, freedom from progression in group 3 was superior to groups 1 and 2. Acute (<= 3 months after radiotherapy) grade 2 or worse adverse events were significantly more common in group 3 (246 [44%] of 563 patients) than in group 2 (201 [36%] of 563; p=0.0034), which, in turn, were more common than in group 1 (98 [18%] of 547; p<0.0001). Similar findings were observed for grade 3 or worse adverse events. However, late toxicity (>3 months after radiotherapy) did not differ significantly between the groups, apart from more late grade 2 or worse blood or bone marrow events in group 3 versus group 2 (one-sided p=0.0060) attributable to the addition of PLNRT in this group. Interpretation The results of this randomised trial establish the benefit of adding short-term ADT to PBRT to prevent progression in prostate cancer. To our knowledge, these are the first such findings to show that extending salvage radiotherapy to treat the pelvic lymph nodes when combined with short-term ADT results in meaningful reductions in progression after prostatectomy in patients with prostate cancer.

In part 2, we randomly assigned children (6 to 11 years of age) in a 3:1 ratio to receive two injections of mRNA-1273 (50 mu g each) or placebo, administered 28 days apart. The primary objectives were evaluation of the safety of the vaccine in children and the noninferiority of the immune response in these children to that in young adults (18 to 25 years of age) in a related phase 3 trial. Secondary objectives included determination of the incidences of confirmed Covid-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, regardless of symptoms. Interim analysis results are reported.& nbsp;RESULTS & nbsp;In part 1 of the trial, 751 children received 50-mu g or 100-mu g injections of the mRNA-1273 vaccine, and on the basis of safety and immunogenicity results, the 50-mu g dose level was selected for part 2. In part 2 of the trial, 4016 children were randomly assigned to receive two injections of mRNA-1273 (50 mu g each) or placebo and were followed for a median of 82 days (interquartile range, 14 to 94) after the first injection. This dose level was associated with mainly low-grade, transient adverse events, most commonly injection-site pain, headache, and fatigue. No vaccine-related serious adverse events, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, myocarditis, or pericarditis were reported as of the data-cutoff date. One month after the second injection (day 57), the neutralizing antibody titer in children who received mRNA-1273 at a 50-mu g level was 1610 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1457 to 1780), as compared with 1300 (95% CI, 1171 to 1443) at the 100-mu g level in young adults, with serologic responses in at least 99.0% of the participants in both age groups, findings that met the prespecified noninferiority success criterion.

GSDMs are activated by proteolytic removal of autoinhibitory carboxy-terminal domains, typically by caspase regulators(1-9). However, no activator is known for one member of this family, GSDMA. Here we show that the major human pathogen group A Streptococcus (GAS) secretes a protease virulence factor, SpeB, that induces GSDMA-dependent pyroptosis. SpeB cleavage of GSDMA releases an active amino-terminal fragment that can insert into membranes to form lytic pores. GSDMA is primarily expressed in the skin 10 , and keratinocytes infected with SpeB-expressing GAS die of GSDMA-dependent pyroptosis. Mice have three homologues of human GSDMA, and triple-knockout mice are more susceptible to invasive infection by a pandemic hypervirulent M1T1 clone of GAS. These results indicate that GSDMA is critical in the immune defence against invasive skin infections by GAS. Furthermore, they show that GSDMs can act independently of host regulators as direct sensors of exogenous proteases. As SpeB is essential for tissue invasion and survival within skin cells, these results suggest that GSDMA can act akin to a guard protein that directly detects concerning virulence activities of microorganisms that present a severe infectious threat.",MAY 19,2022,605,7910,527,+,,10.1038/s41586-022-04717-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04717-x,MAY 2022,35545676,WOS:000793701500009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we evaluated blinatumomab as induction and consolidation therapy followed by prednisone, vincristine, 6-mercaptopurine, and methotrexate (POMP) maintenance chemotherapy in this patient population. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients were treated at National Clinical Trial Network sites. Eligibility criteria included age >= 65 years and newly diagnosed Ph chromosome-negative B-ALL. Patients received blinatumomab as induction for one-two cycles until attainment of response (complete remission (CR) and CR with incomplete count recovery). Patients then received three cycles of consolidation with blinatumomab followed by 18 months of POMP maintenance chemotherapy. Eight doses of intrathecal methotrexate were administered as central nervous system prophylaxis. RESULTS Twenty-nine eligible patients were enrolled. The median age was 75 years, and the median bone marrow blast count at diagnosis was 87%. Cytogenetic risk was poor in 10 patients (34%), and five of 14 patients (36%) tested had the Ph-like ALL gene signature. Nineteen patients (66%; 95% CI, 46 to 82) achieved CR. Kaplan-Meier 3-year disease-free survival and overall survival estimates were 37% (95% CI, 17 to 57) and 37% (95% CI, 20 to 55), respectively. CONCLUSION Blinatumomab was well tolerated and effective in the treatment of older patients with newly diagnosed Ph chromosome-negative B-ALL, including patients with poor-risk cytogenetics.

Even with the compromised blood-brain barrier and highly angiogenic blood-tumor barrier seen in glioblastoma (GBM), most drugs, including nanomaterial-based formulations, hardly reach intracranial tumors. This work investigates sub-5 nm ultrafine iron oxide nanoparticles (uIONP) with 3.5 nm core diameter as a carrier for delivering DNA topoisomerase inhibitor 7-ethyl-10-hydroxyl camptothecin (SN38) to treat GBM. Given a higher surface-to-volume ratio, uIONP shows one- or three-folds higher SN38 loading efficiency (48.3 +/- 6.1%, mg/mg Fe) than those with core sizes of 10 or 20 nm. SN38 encapsulated in the coating polymer exhibits pH sensitive release with <10% over 48 h at pH 7.4, but 86% at pH 5, thus being protected from converting to inactive glucuronide by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1. Conjugating alpha(v)beta(3)-integrin-targeted cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-Cys) (RGD) as ligands, RGD-uIONP/SN38 demonstrates targeted cytotoxicity to alpha(v)beta(3)-integrin-overexpressed U87MG GBM cells with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 30.9 +/- 2.2 nm.

Infection of humans with viruses for which we typically have little or no prior immunity can result in epidemics with high morbidity and mortality. These epidemics can have public health and economic impact and can exacerbate civil unrest or political instability. Changes in human behavior in the past few decades-increased global travel, farming intensification, the exotic animal trade, and the impact of global warming on animal migratory patterns, habitats, and ecosystems-contribute to the increased frequency of cross-species transmission events. Investing in the pre-clinical advancement of vaccine candidates against diverse emerging viral threats is crucial for pandemic preparedness. Replication-defective adenoviral (Ad) vectors have demonstrated their utility as an outbreak-responsive vaccine platform during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Ad vectors are easy to engineer; are amenable to rapid, inexpensive manufacturing; are relatively safe and immunogenic in humans; and, importantly, do not require specialized cold-chain storage, making them an ideal platform for equitable global distribution or stockpiling.

This Review discusses the epidemiology, phenotypes and pathogenesis of T2DM in India and China and evaluates options for optimal pharmacological management. Nearly half of all adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) live in India and China. These populations have an underlying predisposition to deficient insulin secretion, which has a key role in the pathogenesis of T2DM. Indian and Chinese people might be more susceptible to hepatic or skeletal muscle insulin resistance, respectively, than other populations, resulting in specific forms of insulin deficiency. Cluster-based phenotypic analyses demonstrate a higher frequency of severe insulin-deficient diabetes mellitus and younger ages at diagnosis, lower beta-cell function, lower insulin resistance and lower BMI among Indian and Chinese people compared with European people. Individuals diagnosed earliest in life have the most aggressive course of disease and the highest risk of complications. These characteristics might contribute to distinctive responses to glucose-lowering medications. Incretin-based agents are particularly effective for lowering glucose levels in these populations; they enhance incretin-augmented insulin secretion and suppress glucagon secretion. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors might also lower blood levels of glucose especially effectively among Asian people, while alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are better tolerated in east Asian populations versus other populations. Further research is needed to better characterize and address the pathophysiology and phenotypes of T2DM in Indian and Chinese populations, and to further develop individualized treatment strategies.",JUL,2022,18,7,413,432,,10.1038/s41574-022-00669-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41574-022-00669-4,MAY 2022,35508700,WOS:000790701200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Bacterial populations in ST contribute to taste, but their presence can also create carcinogenic, Tobacco-Specific N-nitrosamines (TSNAs). Previous studies of microbial communities in tobacco products lacked chemistry data (e.g. nicotine, TSNAs) to characterize the products and identify associations between carcinogen levels and taxonomic groups. This study uses statistical analysis to identify potential associations between microbial and chemical constituents in moist snuff products. Methods We quantitatively analyzed 38 smokeless tobacco products for TSNAs using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and nicotine using gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Moisture content determinations (by weight loss on drying), and pH measurements were also performed. We used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize the microbial composition, and additionally measured total 16S bacterial counts using a quantitative PCR assay. Results Our findings link chemical constituents to their associated bacterial populations. We found core taxonomic groups often varied between manufacturers. When manufacturer and flavor were controlled for as confounding variables, the genus Lactobacillus was found to be positively associated with TSNAs. while the genera Enteractinococcus and Brevibacterium were negatively associated. Three genera (Corynebacterium, Brachybacterium, and Xanthomonas) were found to be negatively associated with nicotine concentrations. Associations were also investigated separately for products from each manufacturer. Products from one manufacturer had a positive association between TSNAs and bacteria in the genus Marinilactibacillus. Additionally, we found that TSNA levels in many products were lower compared with previously published chemical surveys.

We aimed to simulate these real-world scenarios and evaluate the effects of image source institution, diagnoses outside of the training set, and other image artifacts on classification accuracy, with the goal of informing clinicians and regulatory agencies about safety and real-world accuracy. Methods We designed a large dermoscopic image classification challenge to quantify the performance of machine learning algorithms for the task of skin cancer classification from dermoscopic images, and how this performance is affected by shifts in statistical distributions of data, disease categories not represented in training datasets, and imaging or lesion artifacts. Factors that might be beneficial to performance, such as clinical metadata and external training data collected by challenge participants, were also evaluated. 25331 training images collected from two datasets (in Vienna [HAM10000] and Barcelona [BCN20000]) between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2018, across eight skin diseases, were provided to challenge participants to design appropriate algorithms. The trained algorithms were then tested for balanced accuracy against the HAM10000 and BCN20000 test datasets and data from countries not included in the training dataset (Turkey, New Zealand, Sweden, and Argentina). Test datasets contained images of all diagnostic categories available in training plus other diagnoses not included in training data (not trained category). We compared the performance of the algorithms against that of 18 dermatologists in a simulated setting that reflected intended clinical use. Findings 64 teams submitted 129 state-of-the-art algorithm predictions on a test set of 8238 images. The best performing algorithm achieved 58.8% balanced accuracy on the BCN20000 data, which was designed to better reflect realistic clinical scenarios, compared with 82.0% balanced accuracy on HAM10000, which was used in a previously published benchmark. Shifted statistical distributions and disease categories not included in training data contributed to decreases in accuracy. Image artifacts, including hair, pen markings, ulceration, and imaging source institution, decreased accuracy in a complex manner that varied based on the underlying diagnosis. When comparing algorithms to expert dermatologists (2460 ratings on 1269 images), algorithms performed better than experts in most categories, except for actinic keratoses (similar accuracy on average) and images from categories not included in training data (26% correct for experts vs 6% correct for algorithms, p<0.0001). For the top 25 submitted algorithms, 47.1% of the images from categories not included in training data were misclassified as malignant diagnoses, which would lead to a substantial number of unnecessary biopsies if current state-of-the-art AI technologies were clinically deployed. Interpretation We have identified specific deficiencies and safety issues in AI diagnostic systems for skin cancer that should be addressed in future diagnostic evaluation protocols to improve safety and reliability in clinical practice.

Assessing primary care clinics' readiness to implement these interventions can help clinics use strengths, identify barriers, and plan for success. However, clinics may lack tools to assess readiness and use findings to plan for successful implementation. To address this need, we developed the Field Guide for Assessing Readiness to Implement Evidence-Based Cancer Screening Interventions (Field Guide) for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Colorectal Cancer Control Program (CRCCP). We conducted a literature review of evidence and existing tools to measure implementation readiness, reviewed readiness tools from selected CRCCP award recipients (n = 35), and conducted semi structured interviews with key informants (n = 8). We sought feedback from CDC staff and recipients to inform the final document. The Field Guide, which is publicly available online, outlines 4 assessment phases: 1) convene team members and determine assessment activities, 2) design and administer the readiness assessment, 3) evaluate assessment data, and 4) develop an implementation plan. Assessment activities and tools are included to facilitate completion of each phase. The Field Guide integrates implementation science and practical experience into a relevant tool to bolster clinic capacity for implementation, increase potential for intervention sustainability, and improve colorectal cancer screening rates, with a focus on patients served in safety net clinic settings.

Major reports from various sources document higher rates of health issues (e.g., substance abuse, depression, suicidality, cardiovascular disease) among SGMs than heterosexuals. Chronic stress related to marginalization and discrimination is a key contributor to these disparities. The nursing profes-sion has paid relatively little attention to SGM health issues. Purpose and Methods: To address these gaps, the first National Nursing LGBTQ Health Summit brought together nursing deans, leaders of national nursing organizations, and other participants from across the United States. Findings: Participants agreed that increasing SGM-specific content in nursing cur-ricula, practice guidelines, faculty development, and research is necessary to improve the health of SGM people. Discussion: The Summit ended with a call to action for the nursing profession to prioritize SGM health through innovations in education, research, and practice.

To enhance understanding of turbulence, we expanded upon and added refinements to an early conceptualization that included communication and workload as major sources of turbulence. For communication, the contributions of interruptions and handoffs are further explored. For workload, patient turnover and supplies/ equipment are further explored; human resources and the built environment were added. Potential consequences of turbulence are also identified including increased cognitive work, increased workarounds, and diminished nurse wellbeing. Actions to address turbulent workflow include teaching students and nurses strategies to manage turbulence; attending to the practice environment such as staffing composition, remedying longstanding issues with supplies and equipment, and developing technology platforms with nurse input; and suggesting investigations to advance understanding of how turbulence influences nurses and to devise effective interventions.

To effectively manage cancer pain, there is a need to understand how caregiving dyads appraise symptoms. Dyadic appraisal of symptoms influences whether the dyad perceives the patient's pain is managed well and whether they are on the same page with their appraisal. Beliefs can act as barriers to the dyadic appraisal. Objectives. This secondary data analysis examined incongruence within Black cancer caregiving dyads regarding beliefs about pain management and potential medication side effects using the Barriers Questionnaire-13. Associated factors were also examined. Methods. Guided by the Theory of Dyadic Illness Management, dyadic multilevel modeling was conducted with data from 60 Black cancer caregiving dyads to determine the dyadic appraisal of beliefs about pain management and potential medication side effects, which includes the average perception of barriers within the dyad (i.e., dyadic average) and the dyadic incongruence (i.e., gap between patient and caregiver). Results. On average, Black cancer caregiving dyads reported moderate barriers regarding pain management (2.262 (SE=0.102, P<0.001) and medication side effects (2.223 (SE=0.144, P<0.001). There was significant variability across dyads regarding barriers to pain management and medication side effects. Lower patient education and higher patient-reported pain interference were significantly associated with more perceived barriers to pain management and potential medication side effects. Incongruence within dyads regarding barriers to pain management and medication side effects were significantly associated with the caregiver's report of patient's pain interference. Conclusion. Findings suggest the importance of appraisal that includes both members of Black cancer caregiving dyads regarding pain management. (C) 2022 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine.

The Colorectal Cancer Control Program (CRCCP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) seeks to increase screening in health system clinics through implementation of evidence-based interventions (EBIs) and supporting activities (SAs). This program provided an opportunity to assess the uptake of EBIs and SAs in 355 clinics that participated from 2015 to 2018. Intervention Approach The 30 funded awardees of CRCCP partnered with clinics to im-plement at least 2 of 4 EBIs that CDC prioritized (patient remind-ers, provider reminders, reducing structural barriers, provider as-sessment and feedback) and 4 optional strategies that CDC identi-fied as SAs (small media, professional development and provider education, patient navigation, and community health workers). Evaluation Methods Clinics completed 3 annual surveys to report uptake, implementa-tion, and integration and perceived sustainability of the priority EBIs and SAs. Results In our sample of 355 clinics, uptake of 4 EBIs and 2 SAs signific-antly increased over time. By year 3, 82% of clinics implemented patient reminder systems, 88% implemented provider reminder systems, 82% implemented provider assessment and feedback, 76% implemented activities to reduce structural barriers, 51% im-plemented provider education, and 84% used small media. Most clinics that implemented these strategies (>90%) considered them fully integrated into the health system or clinic operations and sus-tainable by year 3. Fewer clinics used patient navigation (30%) and community health workers (19%), with no increase over the years of the study. Implications for Public Health Clinics participating in the CRCCP reported high uptake and per-ceived sustainability of EBIs that can be integrated into electronic medical record systems but limited uptake of patient navigation and community health workers, which are uniquely suited to re-duce cancer disparities. Future research should determine how to promote uptake and assess cost-effectiveness of CRCCP interventions.",MAY,2022,19,,,,E26,,,,35588522,WOS:000800596600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The prevalence of anaemia in women aged 15-49 years, by pregnancy status, is indicator 2.2.3 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and the aim of halving the anaemia prevalence in women of reproductive age by 2030 is an extension of the 2025 global nutrition targets endorsed by the World Health Assembly (WHA). We aimed to estimate the prevalence of anaemia by severity for children aged 6-59 months, non-pregnant women aged 15-49 years, and pregnant women aged 15-49 years in 197 countries and territories and globally for the period 2000-19. Methods For this pooled analysis of population-representative data, we collated 489 data sources on haemoglobin distribution in children and women from 133 countries, including 4.5 million haemoglobin measurements. Our data sources comprised health examination, nutrition, and household surveys, accessed as anonymised individual records or as summary statistics such as mean haemoglobin and anaemia prevalence. We used a Bayesian hierarchical mixture model to estimate haemoglobin distributions in each population and country-year. This model allowed for coherent estimation of mean haemoglobin and prevalence of anaemia by severity. Findings Globally, in 2019, 40% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 36-44) of children aged 6-59 months were anaemic, compared to 48% (45-51) in 2000. Globally, the prevalence of anaemia in non-pregnant women aged 15-49 years changed little between 2000 and 2019, from 31% (95% UI 28-34) to 30% (27-33), while in pregnant women aged 15-49 years it decreased from 41% (39-43) to 36% (34-39). In 2019, the prevalence of anaemia in children aged 6-59 months exceeded 70% in 11 countries and exceeded 50% in all women aged 15-49 years in ten countries. Globally in all populations and in most countries and regions, the prevalence of mild anaemia changed little, while moderate and severe anaemia declined in most populations and geographical locations, indicating a shift towards mild anaemia. Interpretation Globally, regionally, and in nearly all countries, progress on anaemia in women aged 15-49 years is insufficient to meet the WHA global nutrition target to halve anaemia prevalence by 2030, and the prevalence of anaemia in children also remains high. A better understanding of the context-specific causes of anaemia and quality implementation of effective multisectoral actions to address these causes are needed.

Then, to provide a more comprehensive picture of the global burden of mortality associated with temperature variability, global gridded temperature data with a resolution of 0.5 degrees x0.5 degrees were used to assess the temperature variability-related mortality burden at the global, regional, and national levels. Furthermore, temporal trends in temperature variability-related mortality burden were also explored from 2000-19. Methods In this modelling study, we applied a three-stage meta-analytical approach to assess the global temperature variability-related mortality burden at a spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees x0.5 degrees from 2000-19. Temperature variability was calculated as the SD of the average of the same and previous days' minimum and maximum temperatures. We first obtained location-specific temperature variability related-mortality associations based on a daily time series of 750 locations from the Multi-country Multi-city Collaborative Research Network. We subsequently constructed a multivariable meta-regression model with five predictors to estimate grid-specific temperature variability related-mortality associations across the globe. Finally, percentage excess in mortality and excess mortality rate were calculated to quantify the temperature variability-related mortality burden and to further explore its temporal trend over two decades. Findings An increasing trend in temperature variability was identified at the global level from 2000 to 2019. Globally, 1753392 deaths (95% CI 1159 901-2357 718) were associated with temperature variability per year, accounting for 3.4% (2.2-4.6) of all deaths. Most of Asia, Australia, and New Zealand were observed to have a higher percentage excess in mortality than the global mean. Globally, the percentage excess in mortality increased by about 4.6% (3.7-5.3) per decade. The largest increase occurred in Australia and New Zealand (7.3%, 95% CI 4-3-10.4), followed by Europe (4.4%, 2.2-5.6) and Africa (3.3, 1- 9-4.6). Interpretation Globally, a substantial mortality burden was associated with temperature variability, showing geographical heterogeneity and a slightly increasing temporal trend. Our findings could assist in raising public awareness and improving the understanding of the health impacts of temperature variability. Copyright (C) 2022 The Author(s).

The Nurturing Care Framework, as adapted to age 20 years, conceptualises the major influences during periods of development from preconception, through pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence that affect human capital. In addition to mortality in children younger than 5 years, stillbirths and deaths in 5-19-year-olds are important to consider. The global rate of mortality in individuals younger than 20 years has declined substantially since 2000, yet in 2019 an estimated 8.6 million deaths occurred between 28 weeks of gestation and 20 years of age, with more than half of deaths, including stillbirths, occurring before 28 days of age. The 1000 days from conception to 2 years of age are especially influential for human capital. The prevalence of low birthweight is high in sub-Saharan Africa and even higher in south Asia. Growth faltering, especially from birth to 2 years, occurs in most world regions, whereas overweight increases in many regions from the preprimary school period through adolescence. Analyses of cohort data show that growth trajectories in early years of life are strong determinants of nutritional outcomes in adulthood. The accrual of knowledge and skills is affected by health, nutrition, and home resources in early childhood and by educational opportunities in older children and adolescents. Linear growth in the first 2 years of life better predicts intelligence quotients in adults than increases in height in older children and adolescents. Learning-adjusted years of schooling range from about 4 years in sub-Saharan Africa to about 11 years in high-income countries. Human capital depends on children and adolescents surviving, thriving, and learning until adulthood.",APR 30,2022,399,10336,1730,1740,,10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02533-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02533-2,,35489357,WOS:000798562500022,View Full Record in Web of Science

We then used the miRNA expression data in TCGA to evaluate each miRNA's ability to predict the survival outcome of patients in each cancer-drug group. As a result, the identified miRNAs are predictive of survival outcomes in a cancer-specific and drug-specific manner. Notably, most of the drug-specific miRNA survival markers and their target genes showed consistency in terms of correlations in their expression and their correlations with survival. Some of the identified miRNAs were supported by published literature in contexts of various cancers. We explored several additional breast cancer datasets that provided miRNA expression and survival data, and showed that our drug-specific miRNA survival markers for breast cancer were able to effectively stratify the prognosis of patients in those additional datasets.

Secondary efficacy end points were the average change from baseline in the hemoglobin level, markers of hemolysis and hematopoiesis, and the change from baseline at week 24 in two pyruvate kinase deficiency-specific patient-reported outcome measures.ResultsSixteen of the 40 patients (40%) in the mitapivat group had a hemoglobin response, as compared with none of the 40 patients in the placebo group (adjusted difference, 39.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, 24.1 to 54.6; two-sided P < 0.001). Patients who received mitapivat had a greater response than those who received placebo with respect to each secondary end point, including the average change from baseline in the hemoglobin level. The most common adverse events were nausea (in 7 patients [18%] in the mitapivat group and 9 patients [23%] in the placebo group) and headache (in 6 patients [15%] and 13 patients [33%], respectively). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 10 patients (25%) who received mitapivat and 5 patients (13%) who received placebo.ConclusionsIn patients with pyruvate kinase deficiency, mitapivat significantly increased the hemoglobin level, decreased hemolysis, and improved patient-reported outcomes. No new safety signals were identified in the patients who received mitapivat.

Forecasting models provide specific, quantitative, and evaluable predictions that inform short-term decisions such as healthcare staffing needs, school closures, and allocation of medical supplies. Starting in April 2020, the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub (https:// covid19forecasthub.org/) collected, disseminated, and synthesized tens of millions of specific predictions from more than 90 different academic, industry, and independent research groups. A multimodel ensemble forecast that combined predictions from dozens of groups every week provided the most consistently accurate probabilistic forecasts of incident deaths due to COVID-19 at the state and national level from April 2020 through October 2021. The performance of 27 individual models that submitted complete forecasts of COVID-19 deaths consistently throughout this year showed high variability in forecast skill across time, geospatial units, and forecast horizons. Two-thirds of the models evaluated showed better accuracy than a naive baseline model. Forecast accuracy degraded as models made predictions further into the future, with probabilistic error at a 20-wk horizon three to five times larger than when predicting at a 1-wk horizon. This project underscores the role that collaboration and active coordination between governmental public-health agencies, academic modeling teams, and industry partners can play in developing modern modeling capabilities to support local, state, and federal response to outbreaks.",APR 12,2022,119,15,,,e2113561119,10.1073/pnas.2113561119,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2113561119,,35394862,WOS:000819659900005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Immune cells are critical responders to muscle injury and guide tissue resident stem cell- and progenitor-mediated myogenic repair. However, how immune cell infiltration and intercellular communication networks with muscle stem cells are altered following VML and drive pathological outcomes remains underexplored. Herein, we contrast the cellular and molecular mechanisms of VML injuries that result in the fibrotic degeneration or regeneration of SkM. Following degenerative VML injuries, we observed the heightened infiltration of natural killer (NK) cells as well as the persistence of neutrophils beyond 2 wk postinjury. Functional validation of NK cells revealed an antagonistic role in neutrophil accumulation in part via inducing apoptosis and CCR1-mediated chemotaxis. The persistent infiltration of neutrophils in degenerative VML injuries was found to contribute to impairments in muscle stem cell regenerative function, which was also attenuated by transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1). Blocking TGF beta signaling reduced neutrophil accumulation and fibrosis and improved muscle-specific force. Collectively, these results enhance our understanding of immune cell-stem cell cross talk that drives regenerative dysfunction and provide further insight into possible avenues for fibrotic therapy exploration.",APR 12,2022,119,15,,,e2111445119,10.1073/pnas.2111445119,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2111445119,,35377804,WOS:000789367500013,View Full Record in Web of Science

We generated and analyzed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to characterize the transcriptomes of cells from hBM across lactational time from 3 to 632 d postpartum in 15 donors. We found that the majority of cells in hBM are lactocytes, a specialized epithelial subset, and that cell-type frequencies shift over the course of lactation, yielding greater epithelial diversity at later points. Analysis of lactocytes reveals a continuum of cell states characterized by transcriptional changes in hormone-, growth factor-, and milk production-related pathways. Generalized additive models suggest that one subcluster, LC1 epithelial cells, increases as a function of time postpartum, daycare attendance, and the use of hormonal birth control. We identify several subclusters of macrophages in hBM that are enriched for tolerogenic functions, possibly playing a role in protecting the mammary gland during lactation. Our description of the cellular components of breast milk, their association with maternal-infant dyad metadata, and our quantification of alterations at the gene and pathway levels provide a detailed longitudinal picture of hBM cells across lactational time. This work paves the way for future investigations of how a potential division of cellular labor and differential hormone regulation might be leveraged therapeutically to support healthy lactation and potentially aid in milk production.",APR 12,2022,119,15,,,e2121720119,10.1073/pnas.2121720119,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2121720119,,35377806,WOS:000789365800007,View Full Record in Web of Science

In recent years, the promise of coopting BBB receptor-mediated transport systems for brain drug delivery has increased in large part due to the discovery and engineering of BBB-targeting antibodies. Here we describe an innovative screening platform for identification of new BBB targeting molecules from a class of lamprey antigen recognition proteins known as variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs). Lamprey were immunized with murine brain microvessel plasma membranes, and the resultant repertoire cloned into the yeast surface display system. The library was screened via a unique workflow that identified 16 VLR clones that target extracellular epitopes of in vivo-relevant BBB membrane proteins. Of these, three lead VLR candidates, VLR-Fc-11, VLR-Fc-30, and VLR-Fc-46 selectively target the brain vasculature and traffic within brain microvascular endothelial cells after intravenous administration in mice, with VLR-Fc-30 being confirmed as trafficking into the brain parenchyma.

By meta-analysing the whole exomes of 24,248 schizophrenia cases and 97,322 controls, we implicate ultra-rare coding variants (URVs) in 10 genes as conferring substantial risk for schizophrenia (odds ratios of 3-50, P<2.14x10(-6)) and 32 genes at a false discovery rate of <5%. These genes have the greatest expression in central nervous system neurons and have diverse molecular functions that include the formation, structure and function of the synapse. The associations of the NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptor subunit GRIN2A and AMPA (alpha -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptor subunit GRIA3 provide support for dysfunction of the glutamatergic system as a mechanistic hypothesis in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. We observe an overlap of rare variant risk among schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders(1), epilepsy and severe neurodevelopmental disorders(2), although different mutation types are implicated in some shared genes. Most genes described here, however, are not implicated in neurodevelopment. We demonstrate that genes prioritized from common variant analyses of schizophrenia are enriched in rare variant risk(3), suggesting that common and rare genetic risk factors converge at least partially on the same underlying pathogenic biological processes. Even after excluding significantly associated genes, schizophrenia cases still carry a substantial excess of URVs, which indicates that more risk genes await discovery using this approach. Whole-exome sequencing identifies ten risk genes for schizophrenia implicated by rare protein-coding variants, a subset of which overlap with risk genes in other neurodevelopmental disorders.",APR 21,2022,604,7906,509,+,,10.1038/s41586-022-04556-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04556-w,APR 2022,35396579,WOS:000779867500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, in a two-stage genome-wide association study of up to 76,755 individuals with schizophrenia and 243,649 control individuals, we report common variant associations at 287 distinct genomic loci. Associations were concentrated in genes that are expressed in excitatory and inhibitory neurons of the central nervous system, but not in other tissues or cell types. Using fine-mapping and functional genomic data, we identify120 genes (106 protein-coding) that are likely to underpin associations at some of these loci, including16 genes with credible causal non-synonymous or untranslated region variation. We also implicate fundamental processes related to neuronal function, including synaptic organization, differentiation and transmission. Fine-mapped candidates were enriched for genes associated with rare disruptive coding variants in people with schizophrenia, including the glutamate receptor subunit GRIN2A and transcription factorSP4, and were also enriched for genes implicated by such variants in neurodevelopmental disorders. We identify biological processes relevant to schizophrenia pathophysiology; show convergence of common and rare variant associations in schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental disorders; and provide a resource of prioritized genes and variants to advance mechanistic studies.",APR 21,2022,604,7906,502,+,,10.1038/s41586-022-04434-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04434-5,APR 2022,35396580,WOS:000779867500004,View Full Record in Web of Science

With the goal of basing these reference charts on the largest and most inclusive dataset available, acknowledging limitations due to known biases of MRI studies relative to the diversity of the global population, we aggregated 123,984 MRI scans, across more than 100 primary studies, from 101,457 human participants between 115 days post-conception to 100 years of age. MRI metrics were quantified by centile scores, relative to non-linear trajectories(2) of brain structural changes, and rates of change, over the lifespan. Brain charts identified previously unreported neurodevelopmental milestones(3), showed high stability of individuals across longitudinal assessments, and demonstrated robustness to technical and methodological differences between primary studies. Centile scores showed increased heritability compared with non-centiled MRI phenotypes, and provided a standardized measure of atypical brain structure that revealed patterns of neuroanatomical variation across neurological and psychiatric disorders. In summary, brain charts are an essential step towards robust quantification of individual variation benchmarked to normative trajectories in multiple, commonly used neuroimaging phenotypes.",APR 21,2022,604,7906,525,+,,10.1038/s41586-022-04554-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04554-y,APR 2022,,WOS:000779281700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

These modifications are typically incorporated by a single methyltransferase that acts on one nucleotide target and rRNA methylation directly prevents drug binding, thereby conferring drug resistance. Loss of intrinsic methylation can also result in antibiotic resistance. For example, Mycobacterium tuberculosis becomes sensitized to tuberactinomycin antibiotics, such as capreomycin and viomycin, due to the action of the intrinsic methyltransferase TlyA. TlyA is unique among antibiotic resistance-associated methyltransferases as it has dual 16S and 23S rRNA substrate specificity and can incorporate cytidine-2'-0-methylation within two structurally distinct contexts. Here, we report the structure of a mycobacterial 50S subunit-TlyA complex trapped in a postcatalytic state with a S-adenosyl-L-methionine analog using single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy. Together with complementary functional analyses, this structure reveals critical roles in 23S rRNA substrate recognition for conserved residues across an interaction surface that spans both TlyA domains These interactions position the TlyA active site over the target nucleotide C2144, which is flipped from 23S Helix 69 in a process stabilized by stacking of TlyA residue Phe157 on the adjacent A2143. Base flipping may thus be a common strategy among rRNA methyltransferase enzymes, even in cases where the target site is accessible without such structural reorganization. Finally, functional studies with 30S subunit suggest that the same TlyA interaction surface is employed to recognize this second substrate, but with distinct dependencies on essential conserved residues.",APR 5,2022,119,14,,,e2120352119,10.1073/pnas.2120352119,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120352119,,35357969,WOS:000786513200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Individuals living with underlying health conditions have an increased risk of severe disease or death from COVID-19. Patient advocacy organizations often provide supportive services to these individuals and can offer a unique perspective of the patient experience. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of COVID-19 on access to health services in Latin America, as reported by patient advocacy organizations representing individuals living with autoimmune, chronic, and noncommunicable diseases. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in August 2020 with patient advocacy organizations in Latin America to measure perceived effects from COVID-19 and reported access to health services among individuals living with autoimmune, chronic, and noncommunicable diseases. An original, online survey was developed and deployed in Spanish and Portuguese. Univariate and bivariate analysis was conducted across two main subject areas: perceived patient effects from COVID-19 and patient access to health services. The main outcomes of analysis considered patient access to care during COVID-19 based on type of chronic illness and geographical region in Latin America. Results A total of 81 survey responses were analyzed. A majority (83%) of patient advocacy organizations reported their patients experienced delays receiving their treatment and care services; 52% experienced delays of 30 days or more. Telemedicine was considered available, but not accessible to patients (37%) and a majority (76%) of patients faced challenges with electronic prescriptions. Patients were not likely to receive a multi-month prescription from their doctor (38%) or successfully fill it at the pharmacy (26%). Conclusions According to responses from patient advocacy organizations, individuals living with noncommunicable diseases in Latin America have faced unique challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Data are needed on whether a strategy of targeting a blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg reduces the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes without compromising fetal growth.MethodsIn this open-label, multicenter, randomized trial, we assigned pregnant women with mild chronic hypertension and singleton fetuses at a gestational age of less than 23 weeks to receive antihypertensive medications recommended for use in pregnancy (active-treatment group) or to receive no such treatment unless severe hypertension (systolic pressure, >= 160 mm Hg; or diastolic pressure, >= 105 mm Hg) developed (control group). The primary outcome was a composite of preeclampsia with severe features, medically indicated preterm birth at less than 35 weeks' gestation, placental abruption, or fetal or neonatal death. The safety outcome was small-for-gestational-age birth weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age. Secondary outcomes included composites of serious neonatal or maternal complications, preeclampsia, and preterm birth.ResultsA total of 2408 women were enrolled in the trial. The incidence of a primary-outcome event was lower in the active-treatment group than in the control group (30.2% vs. 37.0%), for an adjusted risk ratio of 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 0.92; P < 0.001). The percentage of small-for-gestational-age birth weights below the 10th percentile was 11.2% in the active-treatment group and 10.4% in the control group (adjusted risk ratio, 1.04; 0.82 to 1.31; P=0.76). The incidence of serious maternal complications was 2.1% and 2.8%, respectively (risk ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.26), and the incidence of severe neonatal complications was 2.0% and 2.6% (risk ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.30). The incidence of any preeclampsia in the two groups was 24.4% and 31.1%, respectively (risk ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.89), and the incidence of preterm birth was 27.5% and 31.4% (risk ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77 to 0.99).ConclusionsIn pregnant women with mild chronic hypertension, a strategy of targeting a blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg was associated with better pregnancy outcomes than a strategy of reserving treatment only for severe hypertension, with no increase in the risk of small-for-gestational-age birth weight.

BMIs consist of reading out motor intent from the neuronal responses monitored in motor regions of the brain and executing intended movements with bionic limbs, reanimated limbs, or exoskeletons. BMIs also allow for the restoration of the sense of touch by electrically activating neurons in somatosensory regions of the brain, thereby evoking vivid tactile sensations and conveying feedback about object interactions. In this review, we discuss the neural mechanisms of motor control and somatosensation in able-bodied individuals and describe approaches to use neuronal responses as control signals for movement restoration and to activate residual sensory pathways to restore touch.

Our objective was to derive and validate a novel risk assessment tool to identify children aged 2-59 months at risk of hospitalised pneumonia-related mortality across various settings. Methods We used primary, baseline, patient-level data from 11 studies, including children evaluated for pneumonia in 20 low-income and middle-income countries. Patients with complete data were included in a logistic regression model to assess the association of candidate variables with the outcome hospitalised pneumonia-related mortality. Adjusted log coefficients were calculated for each candidate variable and assigned weighted points to derive the Pneumonia Research Partnership to Assess WHO Recommendations (PREPARE) risk assessment tool. We used bootstrapped selection with 200 repetitions to internally validate the PREPARE risk assessment tool. Results A total of 27 388 children were included in the analysis (mean age 14.0 months, pneumonia-related case fatality ratio 3.1%). The PREPARE risk assessment tool included patient age, sex, weight-for-age z-score, body temperature, respiratory rate, unconsciousness or decreased level of consciousness, convulsions, cyanosis and hypoxaemia at baseline. The PREPARE risk assessment tool had good discriminatory value when internally validated (area under the curve 0.83, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.84). Conclusions The PREPARE risk assessment tool had good discriminatory ability for identifying children at risk of hospitalised pneumonia-related mortality in a large, geographically diverse dataset.

This study assessed the effect of an oncology nurse-led primary palliative care intervention on illness expectations among patients with advanced cancer. METHODS This study is a secondary analysis of a cluster-randomized trial of primary palliative care conducted at 17 oncology clinics. Adult patients with advanced solid tumors for whom the oncologist would not be surprised if died within 1 year were enrolled. Monthly visits were designed to foster realistic illness expectations by eliciting patient concerns and goals for their medical care and empowering patients and families to engage in discussions with oncologists about treatment options and preferences. Baseline and 3-month questionnaires included questions about life expectancy, treatment intent, and terminal illness acknowledgment. Odds of realistic illness expectations at 3 months were adjusted for baseline responses, patient demographic and clinical characteristics, and intervention dose. RESULTS Among 457 primarily White patients, there was little difference in realistic illness expectations at 3 months between intervention and standard care groups: 12.8% v 11.4% for life expectancy (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.15; 95% CI, 0.59 to 2.22; P = .684); 24.6% v33.3% for treatment intent (aOR = 0.76; 95% CI, 0.44 to 1.27; P = .290); 53.6% v44.7% for terminal illness acknowledgment (aOR = 1.28; 95% CI, 0.81 to 2.00; P = .288). Results did not differ when accounting for variation in clinic sites or intervention dose. CONCLUSION Illness expectations are difficult to change among patients with advanced cancer. Additional work is needed to identify approaches within oncology practices that foster realistic illness expectations to improve patient decision making.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the immunostimulatory interleukin-2 cytokine prodrug bempegaldesleukin (BEMPEG) plus nivolumab (NIVO) as first-line therapy in patients with advanced clear-cell RCC. Methods This was an open-label multicohort, multicenter, single-arm phase 1/2 study; here, we report results from the phase 1/2 first-line RCC cohort (N=49). Patients received BEMPEG 0.006 mg/kg plus NIVO 360 mg intravenously every 3 weeks. The primary objectives were safety and objective response rate (ORR; patients with measurable disease at baseline and at least one postbaseline tumor response assessment). Secondary objectives included overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Exploratory biomarker analyses: association between baseline biomarkers and ORR. Results At a median follow-up of 32.7 months, the ORR was 34.7% (17/49 patients); 3/49 patients (6.1%) had a complete response. Of the 17 patients with response, 14 remained in response for >6 months, and 6 remained in response for >24 months. Median PFS was 7.7 months (95% CI 3.8 to 13.9), and median OS was not reached (95% CI 37.3 to not reached). Ninety-eight per cent (48/49) of patients experienced >= 1 treatment-related adverse event (TRAE) and 38.8% (19/49) had grade 3/4 TRAEs, most commonly syncope (8.2%; 4/49) and increased lipase (6.1%; 3/49). No association between exploratory biomarkers and ORR was observed. Limitations include the small sample size and single-arm design. Conclusions BEMPEG plus NIVO showed preliminary antitumor activity as first-line therapy in patients with advanced clear-cell RCC and was well tolerated.

However, it remains unclear whether age-related cognitive regulators in AD pathologies contribute to life span. Here, we show that C/EBP beta, an A. and inflammatory cytokine-activated transcription factor that promotes AD pathologies via activating asparagine endopeptidase (AEP), mediates longevity in a gene dose-dependent manner in neuronal C/EBP. transgenic mice. C/EBP beta selectively triggers inhibitory GABAnergic neuronal degeneration by repressing FOXOs and up-regulating AEP, leading to aberrant neural excitation and cognitive dysfunction. Overexpression of CEBP-2 or LGMN-1 (AEP) in Caenorhabditis elegans neurons but not muscle stimulates neural excitation and shortens life span. CEBP-2 or LGMN-1 reduces daf-2 mutant-elongated life span and diminishes daf-16-induced longevity. C/EBP beta and AEP are lower in humans with extended longevity and inversely correlated with REST/FOXO1.

MethodsUsing a case-control, test-negative design, we assessed vaccine effectiveness against laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 leading to hospitalization and against critical Covid-19 (i.e., leading to receipt of life support or to death). From July 1, 2021, to February 17, 2022, we enrolled case patients with Covid-19 and controls without Covid-19 at 31 hospitals in 23 states. We estimated vaccine effectiveness by comparing the odds of antecedent full vaccination (two doses of BNT162b2 messenger RNA vaccine) at least 14 days before illness among case patients and controls, according to time since vaccination for patients 12 to 18 years of age and in periods coinciding with circulation of B.1.617.2 (delta) (July 1, 2021, to December 18, 2021) and omicron (December 19, 2021, to February 17, 2022) among patients 5 to 11 and 12 to 18 years of age. ResultsWe enrolled 1185 case patients (1043 [88%] of whom were unvaccinated, 291 [25%] of whom received life support, and 14 of whom died) and 1627 controls. During the delta-predominant period, vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization for Covid-19 among adolescents 12 to 18 years of age was 93% (95% confidence interval [CI], 89 to 95) 2 to 22 weeks after vaccination and was 92% (95% CI, 80 to 97) at 23 to 44 weeks. Among adolescents 12 to 18 years of age (median interval since vaccination, 162 days) during the omicron-predominant period, vaccine effectiveness was 40% (95% CI, 9 to 60) against hospitalization for Covid-19, 79% (95% CI, 51 to 91) against critical Covid-19, and 20% (95% CI, -25 to 49) against noncritical Covid-19. During the omicron period, vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization among children 5 to 11 years of age was 68% (95% CI, 42 to 82; median interval since vaccination, 34 days). ConclusionsBNT162b2 vaccination reduced the risk of omicron-associated hospitalization by two thirds among children 5 to 11 years of age. Although two doses provided lower protection against omicron-associated hospitalization than against delta-associated hospitalization among adolescents 12 to 18 years of age, vaccination prevented critical illness caused by either variant.

Here we show that deep-learning models trained instead on external photographs of the eyes can be used to detect diabetic retinopathy (DR), diabetic macular oedema and poor blood glucose control. We developed the models using eye photographs from 145,832 patients with diabetes from 301 DR screening sites and evaluated the models on four tasks and four validation datasets with a total of 48,644 patients from 198 additional screening sites. For all four tasks, the predictive performance of the deep-learning models was significantly higher than the performance of logistic regression models using self-reported demographic and medical history data, and the predictions generalized to patients with dilated pupils, to patients from a different DR screening programme and to a general eye care programme that included diabetics and non-diabetics.

Ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) are marked by numerous chemical modifications. An abundant group of rRNA modifications, present in all domains of life, is 2'-O-methylation guided by box C/D small nucleolar RNAs, which are part of small ribonucleoprotein complexes (snoRNPs). Although 2'-O-amethylations are required for the proper production of ribosomes, the mechanisms by which these modifications contribute to translation have remained elusive. Here, we show that a change in box C/D snoRNP biogenesis in actively growing yeast cells results in the production of hypo-2'-O-methylated ribosomes with distinct translational properties. Using RiboMethSeq for the quantitative analysis of 2'-O-methylations, we identify site-specific perturbations of the rRNA 2'-O-methylation pattern and uncover sites that are not required for ribosome production under normal conditions. Characterization of the hypo-2'-O-methylated ribosomes reveals significant translational fidelity defects, including frameshifting and near-cognate start codon selection. Using rRNA structural probing, we show that hypo-2'-O-methylation affects the inherent dynamics of the ribosomal subunits and impacts the binding of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1, thereby causing translational defects. Our data reveal an unforeseen spectrum of 2'-O-methylation heterogeneity in yeast rRNA and suggest a significant role for rRNA 2'-O-methylation in regulating cellular translation by controlling ribosome dynamics and ligand binding.",MAR 22,2022,119,12,,,e2117334119,10.1073/pnas.2117334119,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2117334119,,35294285,WOS:000775480500018,View Full Record in Web of Science

Findings In this retrospective cohort study that included 4096 participants, there were statistically significant associations between measures of lower LA function and incident dementia comparing the lowest vs highest quintile for LA reservoir strain (HR, 1.98), conduit strain (HR, 1.50), contractile strain (HR, 1.57), emptying fraction (HR, 1.87), and active emptying fraction (HR, 1.43). Measures of LA size were not significantly associated with incident dementia. Meaning The findings suggest that impaired LA function may be a risk factor associated with dementia. This exploratory retrospective analysis evaluated the association of echocardiographic measures of left atrial function and size with incident dementia in a large community-based cohort. Importance Atrial myopathy-characterized by alterations in left atrial (LA) function and size-is associated with ischemic stroke, independent of atrial fibrillation (AF). Electrocardiographic markers of atrial myopathy are associated with dementia, but it is unclear whether 2-dimensional echocardiographic (2DE)-defined LA function and size are associated with dementia. Objective To examine the association of LA function and size with incident dementia. Design, Setting, and Participants The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study is a community-based prospective cohort. An exploratory, retrospective analysis was conducted. ARIC centers are located in Forsyth County, North Carolina; Jackson, Mississippi; Washington County, Maryland; and suburban Minneapolis, Minnesota. For this analysis, visit 5 (2011-2013) served as the baseline. Participants without prevalent AF and stroke and who had 2DEs in 2011-2013 were included and surveilled through December 31, 2019. Exposures LA function (reservoir strain, conduit strain, contractile strain, emptying fraction, passive emptying fraction, and active emptying fraction), and LA size (maximal and minimal volume index) as evaluated by 2DE. Main Outcomes and Measures Dementia cases were identified using in-person and phone cognitive assessments, hospitalization codes, and death certificates. Cox proportional hazards models were used. Results Among 4096 participants (mean [SD] age, 75 [5] years; 60% women; 22% Black individuals), 531 dementia cases were ascertained over a median follow-up of 6 years. Dementia incidence for the lowest LA quintile was 4.80 for reservoir strain, 3.94 for conduit strain, 3.29 for contractile strain, 4.20 for emptying fraction, 3.67 for passive emptying fraction, and 3.27 for active emptying fraction per 100 person-years. After full-model adjustments, there were statistically significant associations between measures of LA function and dementia; the hazard ratios (HRs) from the lowest vs highest quintile for reservoir strain were 1.98 (95% CI, 1.42-2.75); for conduit strain, 1.50 (95% CI, 1.09-2.06); for contractile strain, 1.57 (95% CI, 1.16-2.14); for emptying fraction, 1.87 (95% CI, 1.31-2.65); and for active emptying fraction, 1.43 (95% CI, 1.04-1.96). LA passive emptying fraction was not significantly associated with dementia (HR, 1.26 [95% CI, 0.93-1.71]). Dementia incidence for the highest LA maximal volume index quintile was 3.18 per 100 person-years (HR for highest vs lowest quintile, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.58-1.02]) and for the highest minimal volume index quintile was 3.50 per 100 person-years (HR for the highest vs lowest quintile, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.71-1.28]). Both measures were not significantly associated with dementia. These findings were robust to sensitivity analyses that excluded participants with incident AF or stroke. Conclusions and Relevance In this exploratory analysis of a US community-based cohort, several echocardiographic measures of lower LA function were significantly associated with an increased risk of subsequent dementia.

The US Food and Drug Administration registration for tisagenlecleucel was based on a complete response (CR) rate of 81%, 12-month overall survival (OS) of 76%, and event-free survival (EFS) of 50%. We report clinical outcomes and analyze covariates of outcomes after commercial tisagenlecleucel. METHODS We conducted a retrospective, multi-institutional study of CAYA with RR B-ALL across 15 US institutions, who underwent leukapheresis shipment to Novartis for commercial tisagenlecleucel. A total of 200 patients were included in an intent-to-treat response analysis, and 185 infused patients were analyzed for survival and toxicity. RESULTS Intent-to-treat analysis demonstrates a 79% morphologic CR rate (95% CI, 72 to 84). The infused cohort had an 85% CR (95% CI, 79 to 89) and 12-month OS of 72% and EFS of 50%, with 335 days of median follow-up. Notably, 48% of patients had low-disease burden (< 5% bone marrow lymphoblasts, no CNS3, or other extramedullary disease), or undetectable disease, pretisagenlecleucel. Univariate and multivariate analyses associate high-disease burden (HB, >= 5% bone marrow lymphoblasts, CNS3, or non-CNS extramedullary) with inferior outcomes, with a 12-month OS of 58% and EFS of 31% compared with low-disease burden (OS; 85%, EFS; 70%) and undetectable disease (OS; 95%, EFS; 72%; P < .0001 for OS and EFS). Grade >= 3 cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity rates were 21% and 7% overall and 35% and 9% in patients with HB, respectively. CONCLUSION Commercial tisagenlecleucel in CAYA RR B-ALL demonstrates efficacy and tolerability. This first analysis of commercial tisagenlecleucel stratified by disease burden identifies HB preinfusion to associate with inferior OS and EFS and increased toxicity.

In particular, much is unknown about how changes of contact patterns and other behaviors including adherence to social distancing, induced by these measures, may have impacted finer-scale transmission dynamics among different age groups. In this paper, we build a stochastic age-specific transmission model to systematically characterize the degree and variation of age-specific transmission dynamics, before and after lifting the lockdown in Georgia, USA. We perform Bayesian (missing-)data-augmentation model inference, leveraging reported age-specific case, seroprevalence and mortality data. We estimate that overall population-level transmissibility was reduced to 41.2% with 95% CI [39%, 43.8%] of the pre-lockdown level in about a week of the announcement of the shelter-in-place order. Although it subsequently increased after the lockdown was lifted, it only bounced back to 62% [58%, 67.2%] of the pre-lockdown level after about a month. We also find that during the lockdown susceptibility to infection increases with age. Specifically, relative to the oldest age group (> 65+), susceptibility for the youngest age group (0-17 years) is 0.13 [0.09, 0.18], and it increases to 0.53 [0.49, 0.59] for 18-44 and 0.75 [0.68, 0.82] for 45-64. More importantly, our results reveal clear changes of age-specific susceptibility (defined as average risk of getting infected during an infectious contact incorporating age-dependent behavioral factors) after the lockdown was lifted, with a trend largely consistent with reported age-specific adherence levels to social distancing and preventive measures. Specifically, the older groups (> 45) (with the highest levels of adherence) appear to have the most significant reductions of susceptibility (e.g., post-lockdown susceptibility reduced to 31.6% [29.3%, 34%] of the estimate before lifting the lockdown for the 6+ group). Finally, we find heterogeneity in case reporting among different age groups, with the lowest rate occurring among the 0-17 group (9.7% [6.4%, 19%]). Our results provide a more fundamental understanding of the impacts of stringent lockdown measures, and finer evidence that other social distancing and preventive measures may be effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission. These results may be exploited to guide more effective implementations of these measures in many current settings (with low vaccination rate globally and emerging variants) and in future potential outbreaks of novel pathogens.",MAR 17,2022,12,1,,,4637,10.1038/s41598-022-08566-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-08566-6,,35301385,WOS:000770396200072,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, little is known about hippocampal place codes when spatial cues provide ambiguous information about finding goals. Nonplace cells, pyramidal cells that fire without strong spatial modulation in an environment, may be well-suited to carry task-relevant information when spatial information is ambiguous. We find that when spatial cues and goal information are conflicting, nonplace cell firing distinguishes between ambiguous spatial cues. On correct trials nonplace cells had higher firing rates and altered gamma-phase modulation at task-relevant cues than on incorrect trials, while place cells showed no such differences. Finally, this goal discrimination in nonplace cells is absent in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease that has memory impairment. Our findings show that nonplace cells differentiate ambiguous goal information that place cells do not, revealing a special contribution to coding by these nonplace cells.",MAR 15,2022,119,11,,,e2107337119,10.1073/pnas.2107337119,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2107337119,,35254897,WOS:000772224400013,View Full Record in Web of Science

This Primer discusses the epidemiology, mechanisms, diagnosis and treatment of HED. Hypertensive eye disease includes a spectrum of pathological changes, the most well known being hypertensive retinopathy. Other commonly involved parts of the eye in hypertension include the choroid and optic nerve, sometimes referred to as hypertensive choroidopathy and hypertensive optic neuropathy. Together, hypertensive eye disease develops in response to acute and/or chronic elevation of blood pressure. Major advances in research over the past three decades have greatly enhanced our understanding of the epidemiology, systemic associations and clinical implications of hypertensive eye disease, particularly hypertensive retinopathy. Traditionally diagnosed via a clinical funduscopic examination, but increasingly documented on digital retinal fundus photographs, hypertensive retinopathy has long been considered a marker of systemic target organ damage (for example, kidney disease) elsewhere in the body. Epidemiological studies indicate that hypertensive retinopathy signs are commonly seen in the general adult population, are associated with subclinical measures of vascular disease and predict risk of incident clinical cardiovascular events. New technologies, including development of non-invasive optical coherence tomography angiography, artificial intelligence and mobile ocular imaging instruments, have allowed further assessment and understanding of the ocular manifestations of hypertension and increase the potential that ocular imaging could be used for hypertension management and cardiovascular risk stratification.",MAR 10,2022,8,1,,,14,10.1038/s41572-022-00342-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41572-022-00342-0,,35273180,WOS:000767221600002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although there is an increased interest in understanding these problems, data are scarce, and contextual factors can cause variability. We prospectively followed a cohort of Ethiopian children (215 post-SAM cases and 215 non-wasted controls), monthly for one year. The post-SAM cases were: age 6-59 months at admission into the community management of acute malnutrition (CMAM) program and being successfully discharged from CMAM (MUAC>11.0cm, weight gain of 20%, absence of oedema and clinically stable for two consecutive weeks). The controls were apparently healthy children from same village who had no history of an episode of AM and were matched 1:1 to a post-SAM child by age and sex. The primary outcomes were: cumulative incidence of acute malnutrition; growth trajectory; cumulative incidence of reported common morbidities, and cumulative proportion and incidence of deaths. The burden of common morbidities was higher among post-SAM than controls; post-SAM children had more frequent illness episodes (Incidence Rate Ratio of any illness 1.39, 95% CI: 1.14, 1.71; p<0.001). The prevalence of SAM was consistently higher among post-SAM cases than the control group, having a 14 times higher risk of developing SAM (Incidence Rate Ratio: 14.1; 95% CI: 3.5, 122.5; p<0.001).

Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects peripheral organs as well as the central nervous system and involves a fundamental role of neuroinflammation in its pathophysiology. Neurohistological and neuroimaging studies support the presence of ongoing and end-stage neuroinflammatory processes in PD. Moreover, numerous studies of peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid from patients with PD suggest alterations in markers of inflammation and immune cell populations that could initiate or exacerbate neuroinflammation and perpetuate the neurodegenerative process. A number of disease genes and risk factors have been identified as modulators of immune function in PD and evidence is mounting for a role of viral or bacterial exposure, pesticides and alterations in gut microbiota in disease pathogenesis. This has led to the hypothesis that complex gene-by-environment interactions combine with an ageing immune system to create the 'perfect storm' that enables the development and progression of PD. We discuss the evidence for this hypothesis and opportunities to harness the emerging immunological knowledge from patients with PD to create better preclinical models with the long-term goal of enabling earlier identification of at-risk individuals to prevent, delay and more effectively treat the disease.",,,,,,,,10.1038/s41577-022-00684-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41577-022-00684-6,MAR 2022,35246670,WOS:000764475400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Pediatric palliative care (PPC) improves quality of life and end-of-life outcomes for children with cancer, but often occurs late in the disease course. The Supportive Care Clinic (SCC) was launched in 2017 to expand outpatient PPC access. Objectives. To describe the inaugural four years (2017-2021) of an academic, consultative, embedded SCC within pediatric oncology. Methods. Descriptive statistics (demographic, disease, treatment, visit, and end-of-life) and change over time were calculated. Results. During the first four years, 248 patients (51.6% male; 58.1% White; 35.5% Black; 13.7% Hispanic/Latino) were seen in SCC, totaling 1,143 clinic visits (median 4, IQR 2,6), including 248 consultations and 895 follow-up visits. Clinic visits grew nearly 300% from year one to four. Primary diagnoses were central nervous system tumor (41.9%), solid tumor (37.5%), and leukemia/lymphoma (17.3%). The first point of PPC contact became SCC (70.6%) for most referred patients. Among the 136 deceased patients (54.8%), 77.9% had a do-not-resuscitate or Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment in place, and 72.8% received hospice care. When known (n = 112), 89.3% died in their preferred location. The time from SCC consultation to death increased from 74 to 226 days over the four years (P < 0.0001). The proportion of SCC consultations that occurred greater than 90 days from death increased from 39.1% in year one to 85.0% in year four. Conclusion.

The capacity to offer these services to children and adolescents with cancer is unknown. METHODS A cross-sectional survey was sent to 220 Children's Oncology Group member institutions regarding institutional characteristics, structure and organization of FP services, and barriers to FP. Standard descriptive statistics were computed for all variables. The association between site-specific factors and selected outcomes was examined using multivariable logistic regression.

Palliative care (PC) research has grown over the last 20 years. Yet, the causal components and pathways of PC interventions remain unclear. Objectives. To document the prevalence and application of theoretical frameworks in developing and testing PC interventions. Methods. We conducted a secondary analysis of previously published systematic reviews of PC randomized clinical trials. Trials were evaluated for explicit mention of a theoretical framework, process or delivery model, or clinical practice guideline that supported the development of the intervention. We used a structured data extraction form to document study population, outcomes, and whether and how authors used a theoretical framework, process/delivery model, or clinical practice guideline. We applied an adapted coding scheme to evaluate use of theoretical frameworks. Results. We reviewed 85 PC trials conducted between 1984 and 2021. Thirty-eight percent (n = 32) of trials explicitly mentioned a theoretical framework, process or delivery model, or clinical practice guideline as a foundation for the intervention design. Only nine trials included a theoretical framework, while the remaining 23 cited a process/delivery model or clinical practice guideline. Conclusion. Most PC trials do not cite a theoretical foundation for their intervention design. Future work should focus on developing and validating new theoretical frameworks and modifying existing theories and models to better explain the mechanisms of the variety of PC interventions.

Currently, the prevalence of unrepresented nursing home (NH) residents and how medical decisions are made is unknown. We examined (1) the prevalence of unrepresented NH residents, (2) NH policies and procedures to address medical decision making for those residents, and (3) NH staffs perceptions of medical decision making for unrepresented residents. Design: We reviewed resident medical records and NH policy and procedure documents. We also conducted a survey of NH staff using an investigator-developed questionnaire. Setting and Participants: Sixty-six staff members recruited from 3 NHs (433 residents total) in 1 metropolitan area of Georgia, USA. Methods: Medical records and policy and procedure documents were reviewed using preset criteria. The survey included 31 structured and open-ended questions regarding medical decision-making practices for unrepresented residents (eg, awareness of medical decision-making processes, experiences in medical decision making, and suggestions to improve practice). We used descriptive statistics and conventional content analysis. Results: Four residents (1%) met the criteria of being unrepresented. We found no written statements that specifically addressed medical decision making for unrepresented residents in the participating NHs. Of 66 survey participants, 11 had been involved in medical decision making for unrepresented residents. The most common decisions involved do-not-resuscitate orders, major medical and surgical treatments, and life-sustaining treatments. These decisions were made primarily by relying on the resident's physician or through discussions within the facility's interdisciplinary team. Suggestions included adopting explicit mechanisms or protocols related to decision making for unrepresented residents, education/training, and resources for group-based decision making. Conclusions and Implications: Although prevalence in the 3 NHs was low, NH care providers, ethical and legal professionals, and other key stakeholders should discuss practical approaches and policies to systematically identify unrepresented residents and to improve NHs' medical decision-making practices for them.

Increased serum FGF23 is a well-established predictor of mortality in renal disease, but recent findings linking increased levels to hepatic and cardiac diseases have suggested that other organs are sources of FGF23 or targets of its effects. The potential ability of the liver to produce FGF23 in response to hepatocellular injury was therefore examined. Very low levels of Fgf23 mRNA and FGF23 protein were detected in normal mouse liver, but the amounts increased markedly during acute liver injury from the hepatotoxin carbon tetrachloride. Serum levels of intact FGF23 were elevated during liver injury from carbon tetrachloride. Chronic liver injury induced by a high fat diet or elevated bile acids also increased hepatic FGF23 levels. Stimulation of toll-like receptor (TLR) 4-driven inflammation by gut-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) underlies many forms of liver injury, and LPS induced Fgf23 in the liver as well as in other organs. The LPS-inducible cytokines IL-1 beta and TNF increased hepatic Fgf23 expression as did a TLR2 agonist Pam2CSK3. Analysis of Fgf23 expression and FGF23 secretion in different hepatic cell types involved in liver injury identified the resident liver macrophage or Kupffer cell as a source of hepatic FGF23. LPS and cytokines selectively induced the hormone in these cells but not in hepatocytes or hepatic stellate cells. FGF23 failed to exert any autocrine effect on the inflammatory state of Kupffer cells but did trigger proinflammatory activation of hepatocytes. During liver injury inflammatory factors induce Kupffer cell production of FGF23 that may have a paracrine proinflammatory effect on hepatocytes. Liver-produced FGF23 may have systemic hormonal effects as well that influence diseases in in other organs.",MAR 1,2022,17,3,,,e0264743,10.1371/journal.pone.0264743,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0264743,,35231062,WOS:000849744700041,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, genotyping tools for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) may be limiting in some settings due to high cost and workload. In this study developed a customized stepwise MIRU-VNTR typing that prioritizes high discriminatory loci and validated this method using penitentiary system cohort in the country of Georgia. Methods We used a previously generated MIRU-VNTR dataset from recurrent TB cases (32 cases) in Georgia and a new dataset of TB cases from the penitentiary system (102 cases) recruited from 2014 to 2015. A Hunter-Gaston Discriminatory Index (HGDI) was calculated utilizing a 24 standard loci panel, to select high discriminatory power loci, subsequently defined as the customized Georgia-specific set of loci for initial typing. The remaining loci were scored and hierarchically grouped for second and third step typing of the cohort. We then compared the processing time and costs of the customized stepwise method to the standard 24-loci method. Results For the customized Georgia-specific set that was used for initial typing, 10 loci were selected with a minimum value of 0.32 to the highest HGDI score locus. Customized 10 loci (step 1) typing of 102 Mtb patient isolates revealed 35.7% clustered cases. This proportion was reduced to 19.5% after hierarchical application of 2nd and 3rd step typing with the corresponding groups of loci. Our customized stepwise MIRU-VNTR genotyping approach reduced the quantity of samples to be typed and therefore overall processing time and costs by 42.6% each. Conclusion Our study shows that our customized stepwise MIRU-VNTR typing approach is a valid alternative of standard MIRI-VNTR typing panels for molecular epidemiological investigation in Georgia that saves time, workload and costs.

LGBTQI+ people commonly experience mistreatment from nurses and healthcare providers due to a lack of knowledge or personal biases. To date, few instruments exist to guide LGBTQI+-specific curricular improvement. Objectives/design/setting/participant/methods: Johns Hopkins School of Nursing LGBTQI+ Health Initiative and Emory University School of Nursing developed the Tool for Assessing LGBTQI+ Health Training (TALHT) to assist in evaluating gaps and redundancies in LGBTQI+ health content within pre-licensure nursing curricula. Face and content validity were evaluated among experts in LGBTQI+ health, curricular development, nursing education, and measure development (N = 22). The TALHT was modified based on expert feedback and a pilot with pre-licensure faculty (N = 13) to evaluate utility and acceptability of the refined measure. Results: Face and content validity evaluation of the 60-item iteration of the TALHT showed that the majority of items were consistently relevant among external expert reviewers. However, the clarity and readability of items were lacking. We triangulated the quantitative and qualitative data from experts to adapt and reduce the number of items in the TALHT to 20 items. Pilot testing of the revised 20-item measure found that utility and acceptability of the tool were rated highly among pre-licensure faculty.

Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), with a reciprocal function to aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), is involved in airway inflammation. The exact relationship between IGF1R and AhR in lung fibrogenesis is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the cascade pathway involving IGF1R and AhR in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Experimental Approach The AhR and IGF1R expressions were determined in the lungs of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients and in a rodent fibrosis model. Pulmonary fibrosis was evaluated in bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung injury in wild type and AhR knockout (Ahr(-/-)) mice. The effects of IGF1R inhibition and AhR activation in vitro on TGF-beta 1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in Beas2B cells and in vivo on BLM-exposed mice were also examined. Key Results There were increased IGF1R levels but AhR expression decreased in the lung of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients and BLM-induced mice. Knockout of AhR aggravated lung fibrosis, while the use of IGF1R inhibitor and AhR agonist significantly attenuated such effects and inhibited TGF-beta 1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in Beas2B cells. Both TGF-beta 1 and BLM markedly suppressed AhR expression through endoplasmic reticulum stress and consequently, IGF1R activation. The IGF1R inhibitor and specific knockdown of IGF1R reversed the activation of the TGF-beta 1 signal pathway. Conclusion and Implications In the development of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, AhR and IGF1R play opposite roles via the TGF-beta/Smad/STAT signalling cascade.

One of the most challenging tumor segmentation tasks is localization of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Exclusive application of conventional methods does not appear promising. Deep learning approaches has achieved great success in the computer aided diagnosis, especially in biomedical image segmentation. This paper introduces a framework based on convolutional neural network (CNN) for segmentation of PDAC mass and surrounding vessels in CT images by incorporating powerful classic features, as well. First, a 3D-CNN architecture is used to localize the pancreas region from the whole CT volume using 3D Local Binary Pattern (LBP) map of the original image. Segmentation of PDAC mass is subsequently performed using 2D attention U-Net and Texture Attention U-Net (TAU-Net). TAU-Net is introduced by fusion of dense Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and LBP descriptors into the attention U-Net. An ensemble model is then used to cumulate the advantages of both networks using a 3D-CNN. In addition, to reduce the effects of imbalanced data, a multi-objective loss function is proposed as a weighted combination of three classic losses including Generalized Dice Loss (GDL), Weighted Pixel-Wise Cross Entropy loss (WPCE) and boundary loss. Due to insufficient sample size for vessel segmentation, we used the above-mentioned pre-trained networks and fine-tuned them. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the Dice score for PDAC mass segmentation in portal-venous phase by 7.52% compared to state-of-the-art methods in term of DSC. Besides, three dimensional visualization of the tumor and surrounding vessels can facilitate the evaluation of PDAC treatment response.",FEB 23,2022,12,1,,,3092,10.1038/s41598-022-07111-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-07111-9,,35197542,WOS:000760421800062,View Full Record in Web of Science

The mature capsid core is a lattice composed of capsid (CA) monomers thought to assemble first into CA dimers, then into similar to 250 CA hexamers and 12 CA pentamers. CA assembly requires conformational flexibility of each unit, resulting in the presence of unique, solvent-accessible surfaces. Significant advances have improved our understanding of the roles of the capsid core in replication; however, the contributions of individual CA assembly forms remain unclear and there are limited tools available to evaluate these forms in vivo. Here, we have selected aptamers that bind CA lattice tubes. We describe aptamer CA15-2, which selectively binds CA lattice, but not CA monomer or CA hexamer, suggesting that it targets an interface present and accessible only on CA lattice. CA15-2 does not compete with PF74 for binding, indicating that it likely binds a non-overlapping site.

Consequently, the description of oxidants needs to be chemically precise to translate research on their biological effects into therapeutic benefit in redox medicine. This Expert Recommendation article pinpoints key issues associated with identifying the physiological roles of oxidants, focusing on H2O2 and O-2(.-). The generic term ROS should not be used to describe specific molecular agents. We also advocate for greater precision in measurement of H2O2, O-2(.-) and other oxidants, along with more specific identification of their signalling targets. Future work should also consider inter-organellar communication and the interactions of redox-sensitive signalling targets within organs and whole organisms, including the contribution of environmental exposures. To achieve these goals, development of tools that enable site-specific and real-time detection and quantification of individual oxidants in cells and model organisms are needed. We also stress that physiological O-2 levels should be maintained in cell culture to better mimic in vivo redox reactions associated with specific cell types. Use of precise definitions and analytical tools will help harmonize research among the many scientific disciplines working on the common goal of understanding redox biology. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) comprise a wide variety of oxidant molecules with vastly different properties and biological functions in physiology and in disease. Approaches to characterize oxidants in the in vivo context and identify their specific cellular targets will be required to understand and control the pathophysiological activities of ROS.",JUL,2022,23,7,499,515,,10.1038/s41580-022-00456-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41580-022-00456-z,FEB 2022,35190722,WOS:000758986100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

During transcription, RNA polymerase generates supercoiling that may facilitate passage through such barriers. We monitored E. coli RNA polymerase progress along templates in conditions that prevented, or favored, 400 bp LacI-mediated DNA looping. Tethered particle motion measurements revealed that RNA polymerase paused longer at unlooped LacI obstacles or those barring entry to a loop than those barring exit from the loop. Enhanced dissociation of a LacI roadblock by the positive supercoiling generated ahead of a transcribing RNA polymerase within a torsion-constrained DNA loop may be responsible for this reduction in pause time. In support of this idea, RNA polymerase transcribed 6-fold more slowly through looped DNA and paused at LacI obstacles for 66% less time on positively supercoiled compared to relaxed templates, especially under increased tension (torque). Positive supercoiling propagating ahead of polymerase facilitated elongation along topologically complex, protein-coated templates.",MAR 21,2022,50,5,2826,2835,gkac093,10.1093/nar/gkac093,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkac093,FEB 2022,35188572,WOS:000758320100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Five-year survival outcomes have substantially improved with this approach. Despite these advances, further improvements are needed as the majority of patients ultimately develop progression of disease. The next-generation immunotherapy trials are currently being conducted that include approaches such as concurrent immunotherapy and addition of other therapeutic agents in the concurrent and consolidative settings. Specific unmet needs continue to exist for patients who develop disease progression after concurrent chemoradiation and immunotherapy, as well as defining the best treatment for patients with driver mutations. Future directions also include refinement of radiation techniques to reduce toxicities as much as possible, as well as the use of circulating tumor DNA in the surveillance setting. The current scientific landscape shows promising approaches that may further improve outcomes for patients with locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.

We examined whether integrity of the LC-norepinephrine system, assessed with NM-MRI, is associated with stage of AD and with neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), independent of cortical pathophysiology (amyloid-beta and tau burden). Cognitively normal older adults (n = 118), and individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 44), and AD (n = 28) underwent MR imaging and tau and amyloid-beta positron emission tomography (with [F-18]MK6240 and [F-18]AZD4694, respectively). Integrity of the LC-norepinephrine system was assessed based on contrast-to-noise ratio of the LC on NM-MRI images. Braak stage of AD was derived from regional binding of [F-18]MK6240. NPS were assessed with the Mild Behavioral Impairment Checklist (MBI-C). LC signal contrast was decreased in tau-positive participants (t(186) = -4.00, p = 0.0001) and negatively correlated to Braak stage (Spearman rho = -0.31, p = 0.00006). In tau-positive participants (n = 51), higher LC signal predicted NPS severity (rho = 0.35, p = 0.019) independently of tau burden, amyloid-beta burden, and cortical gray matter volume. This relationship appeared to be driven by the impulse dyscontrol domain of NPS, which was highly correlated to LC signal (rho = 0.44, p = 0.0027). NM-MRI reveals loss of LC integrity that correlates to severity of AD. However, LC preservation in AD may also have negative consequences by conferring risk for impulse control symptoms.

Human schistosomes, parasitic flatworms that cycle between freshwater snails and humans, typify this challenge. Human exposure risk, given water contact, is driven by the production of free-living cercariae by snail populations. Conventional epidemiological models and management focus on the density of infected snails under the assumption that all snails are equally infectious. However, individual-level experiments contradict this assumption, showing increased production of schistosome cercariae with greater access to food resources. We built bioenergetics theory to predict how resource competition among snails drives the temporal dynamics of transmission potential to humans and tested these predictions with experimental epidemics and demonstrated consistency with field observations. This resource-explicit approach predicted an intense pulse of transmission potential when snail populations grow from low densities, i.e., when per capita access to resources is greatest, due to the resource-dependence of cercarial production. The experiment confirmed this prediction, identifying a strong effect of infected host size and the biomass of competitors on per capita cercarial production. A field survey of 109 waterbodies also found that per capita cercarial production decreased as competitor biomass increased. Further quantification of snail densities, sizes, cercarial production, and resources in diverse transmission sites is needed to assess the epidemiological importance of resource competition and support snail-based disruption of schistosome transmission. More broadly, this work illustrates how resource competition can sever the correspondence between infectious host density and transmission potential.",FEB 8,2022,119,6,,,e2116512119,10.1073/pnas.2116512119,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2116512119,,35121663,WOS:000758488400006,View Full Record in Web of Science

In mice, large scale cortical neural activity evokes hemodynamic changes readily observable with intrinsic signal imaging (ISI). Pairing ISI with visual stimulation allows identification of primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual areas (HVAs), typically through cranial windows that thin or remove the skull. These procedures can diminish long-term mechanical and physiological stability required for delicate electrophysiological measurements made weeks to months after imaging (e.g., in subjects undergoing behavioral training). Here, we optimized and directly validated an intact skull ISI system in mice. We first assessed how imaging quality and duration affect reliability of retinotopic maps in V1 and HVAs. We then verified ISI map retinotopy in V1 and HVAs with targeted, multi-site electrophysiology several weeks after imaging. Reliable ISI maps of V1 and multiple HVAs emerged with similar to 60 trials of imaging (65 +/- 6 min), and these showed strong correlation to local field potential (LFP) retinotopy in superficial cortical layers (r(2) =0.74-0.82).

Despite increasing discoveries of circRNA function in human neurons, the circRNA landscape and function in developing human oligodendroglia, the myelinating cells that govern neuronal conductance, remains unexplored. Meanwhile, improved experimental and computational tools for the accurate identification of circRNAs are needed. Results We adopt a published experimental approach for circRNA enrichment and develop CARP (CircRNA identification using A-tailing RNase R approach and Pseudo-reference alignment), a comprehensive 21-module computational framework for accurate circRNA identification and quantification. Using CARP, we identify developmentally programmed human oligodendroglia circRNA landscapes in the HOG oligodendroglioma cell line, distinct from neuronal circRNA landscapes. Numerous circRNAs display oligodendroglia-specific regulation upon differentiation, among which a subclass is regulated independently from their parental mRNAs. We find that circRNA flanking introns often contain cis-regulatory elements for RNA editing and are predicted to bind differentiation-regulated splicing factors. In addition, we discover novel oligodendroglia-specific circRNAs that are predicted to sponge microRNAs, which co-operatively promote oligodendroglia development. Furthermore, we identify circRNA clusters derived from differentiation-regulated alternative circularization events within the same gene, each containing a common circular exon, achieving additive sponging effects that promote human oligodendroglia differentiation. Conclusions Our results reveal dynamic regulation of human oligodendroglia circRNA landscapes during early differentiation and suggest critical roles of the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA axis in advancing human oligodendroglia development.",FEB 7,2022,23,1,,,48,10.1186/s13059-022-02621-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-022-02621-1,,35130952,WOS:000752331200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, as much of the cellular content is extruded during spermatogenesis, it is unclear whether cytoplasmic small RNAs can contribute to epigenetic inheritance through sperm. Here we identify a sperm-specific germ granule, termed the paternal epigenetic inheritance (PEI) granule, that mediates paternal epigenetic inheritance by retaining the cytoplasmic Argonaute protein WAGO-3 during spermatogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans. We identify the PEI granule proteins PEI-1 and PEI-2, which have distinct functions in this process: granule formation, Argonaute selectivity and subcellular localization. We show that PEI granule segregation is coupled to the transport of sperm-specific secretory vesicles through PEI-2 in an S-palmitoylation-dependent manner.

To challenge this hypothesis, obese Asian Indian pre-diabetic patients were submitted to diet modifications and physical activity for 4 months (LI group) and compared to a control group which was given recommendations only. We have considered 2 periods of time to analyze the data, i.e.; a first one to study the response to the intervention (4 months), and a second one post-intervention (8 months). At basal, 4 months and 8 months post-intervention the levels of 17 c-miRNAs were quantified, selected either for their relevance to the pathology or because they are known to be modulated by physical activity or diet. Their variations were correlated with variations of 25 metabolic and anthropometric parameters and cytokines. As expected, fasting-glycaemia, insulin-sensitivity, levels of exercise- and obesity-induced cytokines were ameliorated after 4 months. In addition, the levels of 4 miRNAs (i.e.; miR-128-3p, miR-374a-5p, miR-221-3p, and miR-133a-3p) were changed only in the LI group and were correlated with metabolic improvement (insulin sensitivity, cytokine levels, waist circumference and systolic blood pressure). However, 8 months post-intervention almost all ameliorated metabolic parameters declined indicating that the volunteers did not continue the protocol on their own. Surprisingly, the LI positive effects on c-miRNA levels were still detected, and were even more pronounced 8 months post-intervention. In parallel, MCP-1, involved in tissue infiltration by immune cells, and Il-6, adiponectin and irisin, which have anti-inflammatory effects, continued to be significantly and positively modified, 8 months post-intervention. These data demonstrated for the first time, that c-miRNA correlations with metabolic parameters and insulin sensitivity are in fact only indirect and likely associated with the level systemic inflammation. More generally speaking, this important result explains the high variability between the previous studies designed to identify specific c-miRNAs associated with the severity of insulin-resistance. The results of all these studies should take into account the level of inflammation of the patients. In addition, this finding could also explain why, whatever the pathology considered (i.e.; cancers, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, inflammatory diseases) the same subset of miRNAs is always found altered in the blood of patients vs healthy subjects, as these pathologies are all associated with the development of inflammation.",FEB 4,2022,17,2,,,e0263479,10.1371/journal.pone.0263479,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263479,,35120179,WOS:000789273600044,View Full Record in Web of Science

Little is known, however, about the impacts of the pandemic on displaced populations, and how those impacts differ by gender and life stage. We investigate the extent to which the pandemic has compounded pre-existing social inequalities among adolescents in Jordan, and the role support structures play in promoting resilience. Methods Our analysis leverages longitudinal quantitative survey data and in-depth qualitative interviews, collected before and after the onset of COVID-19, with over 3,000 Syrian refugees, stateless Palestinians and vulnerable Jordanians, living in camps, host communities and informal tented settlements. We utilize mixed-methods analysis combining multivariate regression with deductive qualitative tools to evaluate pandemic impacts and associated policy responses on adolescent wellbeing and mental health, at three and nine months after the pandemic onset. We also explore the role of support systems at individual, household, community, and policy levels. Findings We find the pandemic has resulted in severe economic and service disruptions with far-reaching and heterogenous effects on adolescent wellbeing. Nine months into the pandemic, 19.3% of adolescents in the sample presented with symptoms of moderate-to severe depression, with small signs of improvement (3.2 percentage points [pp], p<0.001). Two thirds of adolescents reported household stress had increased during the pandemic, especially for Syrian adolescents in host communities (10.7pp higher than any other group, p<0.001). Social connectedness was particularly low for girls, who were 13.4 percentage points (p<0.001) more likely than boys to have had no interaction with friends in the past 7 days. Adolescent programming shows signs of being protective, particularly for girls, who were 8.8 percentage points (p<0.01) more likely to have a trusted friend than their peers who were not participating in programming. Conclusions Pre-existing social inequalities among refugee adolescents affected by forced displacement have been compounded during the COVID-19 pandemic, with related disruptions to services and social networks. To achieve Sustainable Development Goal targets to support healthy and empowered development in adolescence and early adulthood requires interventions that target the urgent needs of the most vulnerable adolescents while addressing population-level root causes and determinants of psychosocial wellbeing and resilience for all adolescent girls and boys.",FEB 2,2022,17,2,,,e0261773,10.1371/journal.pone.0261773,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0261773,,35108293,WOS:000775890100013,View Full Record in Web of Science

We aimed to investigate a low-cost, theory-driven, behavioural intervention designed to increase latrine use and safe disposal of child faeces in India. Methods We did a cluster-randomised controlled trial between Jan 30, 2018, and Feb 18, 2019, in 66 rural villages in Puri, Odisha, India. Villages were eligible if not adjacent to another included village and not designated by the Government to be open-defecation free. All latrine-owning households in selected villages were eligible. We assigned 33 villages to the intervention via stratified randomisation. The intervention was required to meet a limit of US$20 per household and included a folk performance, transect walk, community meeting, recognition banners, community wall painting, mothers' meetings, household visits, and latrine repairs. Control villages received no intervention. Neither participants nor field assessors were masked to study group assignment. We estimated intervention effects on reported latrine use and safe disposal of child faeces 4 months after completion of the intervention delivery using a differencein-differences analysis and stratified results by sex. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT03274245. Findings We enrolled 3723 households (1807 [48.5%] in the intervention group and 1916 [51.5%] in the control group). Analysis included 14 181 individuals (6921 [48.8%] in the intervention group and 7260 [51.2%] in the control group). We found an increase of 6 - 4 percentage points (95% CI 2.0-10.7) in latrine use and an increase of 15.2 percentage points (7.9-22.5) in safe disposal of child faeces. No adverse events were reported. Interpretation A low-cost behavioural intervention achieved modest increases in latrine use and marked increases in safe disposal of child faeces in the short term but was unlikely to reduce exposure to faecal pathogens to a level necessary to achieve health gains.

DNA methylation (DNAm) studies of human placenta improve our understanding of how its function relates to disease risk. However, DNAm studies can be biased by cell type heterogeneity, so it is essential to control for this in order to reduce confounding and increase precision. Computational cell type deconvolution approaches have proven to be very useful for this purpose. For human placenta, however, an assessment of the performance of these estimation methods is still lacking. Here, we examine the performance of a newly available reference-based cell type estimation approach and compare it to an often-used reference-free cell type estimation approach, namely RefFreeEWAS, in placental genome-wide DNAm samples taken at birth and from chorionic villus biopsies early in pregnancy using three independent studies comprising over 1000 samples. We found both reference-free and reference-based estimated cell type proportions to have predictive value for DNAm, however, reference-based cell type estimation outperformed reference-free estimation for the majority of data sets. Reference-based cell type estimations mirror previous histological knowledge on changes in cell type proportions through gestation. Further, CpGs whose variation in DNAm was largely explained by reference-based estimated cell type proportions were in the proximity of genes that are highly tissue-specific for placenta. This was not the case for reference-free estimated cell type proportions. We provide a list of these CpGs as a resource to help researchers to interpret results of existing studies and improve future DNAm studies of human placenta.",FEB,2022,79,2,,,115,10.1007/s00018-021-04091-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-021-04091-3,,35113241,WOS:000750822900003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most studies have included only White patients, yet Black patients with DCM have higher risk of heart failure-related hospitalization and death. OBJECTIVE To estimate the prevalence of familial DCM among DCM probands and the age-specific cumulative risk of DCM in first-degree relatives across race and ethnicity groups. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A family-based, cross-sectional study conducted by a multisite consortium of 25 US heart failure programs. Participants included patients with DCM (probands), defined as left ventricular systolic dysfunction and left ventricular enlargement after excluding usual clinical causes, and their first-degree relatives. Enrollment commenced June 7, 2016; proband and family member enrollment concluded March 15, 2020, and April 1, 2021, respectively. EXPOSURES The presence of DCM in a proband. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Familial DCM defined by DCM in at least 1 first-degree relative; expanded familial DCM defined by the presence of DCM or either left ventricular enlargement or left ventricular systolic dysfunction without known cause in at least 1 first-degree relative. RESULTS The study enrolled 1220 probands (median age, 52.8 years [IQR, 42.4-61.8]; 43.8% female; 43.1% Black and 8.3% Hispanic) and screened 1693 first-degree relatives for DCM. A median of 28% (IQR, 0%-60%) of living first-degree relatives were screened per family. The crude prevalence of familial DCM among probands was 11.6% overall. The model-based estimate of the prevalence of familial DCM among probands at a typical US advanced heart failure program if all living first-degree relatives were screened was 29.7% (95% CI, 23.5% to 36.0%) overall. The estimated prevalence of familial DCM was higher in Black probands than in White probands (difference, 11.3% [95% CI, 1.9% to 20.8%]) but did not differ significantly between Hispanic probands and non-Hispanic probands (difference. -1.4% [95% Cl. -15.9% to 13.1%]). The estimated prevalence of expanded familial DCM was 56.9% (95% CI, 50.8% to 63.0%) overall. Based on age-specific disease status at enrollment, estimated cumulative risks in first-degree relatives at a typical US advanced heart failure program reached 19% (95% Cl, 13% to 24%) by age 80 years for DCM and 33% (95% CI, 27% to 40%) for expanded DCM inclusive of partial phenotypes. The DCM hazard was higher in first-degree relatives of non-Hispanic Black probands than non-Hispanic White probands (hazard ratio, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.26 to 2.83]).

This key process in adaptive immunity is sparked upon T cell receptor (TCR) binding of antigens within cell-cell junctions stabilized by integrin (LFA-1)/intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) complexes. A long-standing question in this area is whether the forces transmitted through the LFA-1 /ICAM-1 complex tune T cell signaling. Here, we use spectrally encoded DNA tension probes to reveal the first maps of LFA-1 and TCR forces generated by the T cell cytoskeleton upon antigen recognition. DNA probes that control the magnitude of LFA-1 force show that F>12pN potentiates antigen-dependent T cell activation by enhancing T cell-substrate engagement. LFA-1 /ICAM-1 mechanical events with F>12pN also enhance the discriminatory power of the TCR when presented with near cognate antigens.

METHODS ASCO and the Society for Neuro-Oncology convened an Expert Panel and conducted a systematic review of the literature. RESULTS Fifty-nine randomized trials focusing on therapeutic management were identified. RECOMMENDATIONS Adults with newly diagnosed oligodendroglioma, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant, 1p19q codeleted CNS WHO grade 2 and 3 should be offered radiation therapy (RT) and procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine (PCV). Temozolomide (TMZ) is a reasonable alternative for patients who may not tolerate PCV, but no high-level evidence supports upfront TMZ in this setting. People with newly diagnosed astrocytoma, IDH-mutant, 1p19q non-codeleted CNS WHO grade 2 should be offered RT with adjuvant chemotherapy (TMZ or PCV). People with astrocytoma, IDH-mutant, 1p19q non-codeleted CNS WHO grade 3 should be offered RT and adjuvant TMZ. People with astrocytoma, IDH-mutant, CNS WHO grade 4 may follow recommendations for either astrocytoma, IDH-mutant, 1p19q non-codeleted CNS WHO grade 3 or glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, CNS WHO grade 4. Concurrent TMZ and RT should be offered to patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, CNS WHO grade 4 followed by 6 months of adjuvant TMZ. Alternating electric field therapy, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, should be considered for these patients. Bevacizumab is not recommended. In situations in which the benefits of 6-week RT plus TMZ may not outweigh the harms, hypofractionated RT plus TMZ is reasonable. In patients age >= 60 to >= 70 years, with poor performance status or for whom toxicity or prognosis are concerns, best supportive care alone, RT alone (for MGMT promoter unmethylated tumors), or TMZ alone (for MGMT promoter methylated tumors) are reasonable treatment options.

Palliative care access is fundamental to the highest attainable standard of health and a core component of universal health coverage. Forging universal palliative care access is insurmountable without strategically optimizing the nursing workforce and integrating palliative nursing into health systems at all levels. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored both the critical need for accessible palliative care to alleviate serious health-related suffering and the key role of nurses to achieve this goal. Objectives. 1) Summarize palliative nursing contributions to the expansion of palliative care access; 2) identify emerging nursing roles in alignment with global palliative care recommendations and policy agendas; 3) promote nursing leadership development to enhance universal access to palliative care services. Methods. Empirical and policy literature review; best practice models; recommendations to optimize the palliative nursing workforce. Results. Nurses working across settings provide a considerable untapped resource that can be leveraged to advance palliative care access and palliative care program development. Best practice models demonstrate promising approaches and outcomes related to education and training, policy and advocacy, and academic-practice partnerships. Conclusion. An estimated 28 million nurses account for 59% of the international healthcare workforce and deliver up to 90% of primary health services. It has been well-documented that nurses are often the first or only healthcare provider available in many parts of the world. Strategic investments in international and interdisciplinary collaboration, as well as policy changes and the safe expansion of high-quality nursing care, can optimize the efforts of the global nursing workforce to mitigate serious health-related suffering.

Targeted agents have demonstrated activity across multiple cancer types. BRE12-158 was a phase II, multicenter trial that randomly allocated patients with TNBC with residual disease after NAC to genomically directed therapy versus treatment of physician choice (TPC). PATIENTS AND METHODS From March 2014 to December 2018, 193 patients were enrolled. Residual tumors were sequenced using a next-generation sequencing test. A molecular tumor board adjudicated all results. Patients were randomly allocated to four cycles of genomically directed therapy (arm A) versus TPC (arm B). Patients without a target were assigned to arm B. Primary end point was 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) among randomly assigned patients. Secondary/exploratory end points included distant disease-free survival, overall survival, toxicity assessment, time-based evolution of therapy, and drug-specific outcomes. RESULTS One hundred ninety-three patients were randomly allocated or were assigned to arm B. The estimated 2-year DFS for the randomized population only was 56.6% (95% CI, 0.45 to 0.70) for arm A versus 62.4% (95% CI, 0.52 to 0.75) for arm B. No difference was seen in DFS, distant disease-free survival, or overall survival for the entire or randomized populations. There was increased uptake of capecitabine for TPC over time. Patients randomly allocated later had less distant recurrences. Circulating tumor DNA status remained a significant predictor of outcome with some patients demonstrating clearance with postneoadjuvant therapy. CONCLUSION Genomically directed therapy was not superior to TPC for patients with residual TNBC after NAC. Capecitabine should remain the standard of care; however, the activity of other agents in this setting provides rationale for testing optimal combinations to improve outcomes. Circulating tumor DNA should be considered a standard covariate for trials in this setting.",FEB 1,2022,40,4,345,+,,10.1200/JCO.21.01657,http://dx.doi.org/10.1200/JCO.21.01657,,34910554,WOS:000759292500005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The objective of this study was to examine whether these border closures reduced the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Prior to 2020, the impacts of border closures on disease spread were largely unknown, and their use as a pandemic policy was advised against by international organizations. We tested whether they were helpful in reducing spread by using matching techniques on our hand-coded COVID Border Accountability Project (COBAP) Team database of international closures, converted to a time-series cross-sectional data format. We controlled for national-level internal movement restrictions (domestic lockdowns) using the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) time-series data. We found no evidence in favor of international border closures, whereas we found a strong association between national-level lockdowns and a reduced spread of SARS-CoV-2 cases. More research must be done to evaluate the byproduct effects of closures versus lockdowns as well as the efficacy of other preventative measures introduced at international borders.",FEB 1,2022,12,1,,,1709,10.1038/s41598-022-05482-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-05482-7,,35105912,WOS:000749732100010,View Full Record in Web of Science

We developed Ag-presenting nanoparticles (APNs) for mRNA delivery using pMHCI molecules that were refolded with photocleavable peptides to allow rapid ligand exchange by UV light and site-specifically conjugated with a lipid tail for postinsertion into preformed mRNA lipid nanoparticles. Across different TCR transgenic mouse models (P14, OT-1, and Pmel), UV-exchanged APNs bound and transfected their cognate Ag-specific CD8(+) T cells equivalent to APNs produced using conventionally refolded pMHCI molecules. In mice infected with PR8 influenza, multi-plexed delivery of UV-exchanged APNs against three immunodominant epitopes led to similar to 50% transfection of a VHH mRNA reporter in cognate Ag-specific CD8(+) T cells.

Developing a new, more general, and programmable scheme for establishing allosteric DNA networks remains challenging. Here, we developed a general strategy for programmable allosteric DNA regulations that can be finely tuned by varying the dimensions, positions, and number of conformational signals. By programming the allosteric signals, we realized fan-out/fan-in DNA gates and multiple-layer DNA cascading networks, as well as expanding the approach to long-range allosteric signal transmission through tunable DNA origami nanomachines similar to 100 nm in size.

Plasma neurotransmitters levels (serotonin and norepinephrine) and the gut microbiome profile of the collected fecal samples were examined. Emotional distress and microbiome profile were significantly different between IBS and HC groups. Lower but not significant neurotransmitters' levels (serotonin and norepinephrine) were observed in the IBS group compared to the HC. A negative correlation was found between norepinephrine levels and alpha diversity (Shannon and Simpson indices) in the IBS group. Moreover, serotonin levels were positively associated with the abundance of Proteobacteria, and norepinephrine were positively correlated with Bacteroidetes, but negatively associated with Firmicutes phylum.

N-803 is an IL-15 superagonist comprised of an N72D mutant IL-15 molecule attached to its alpha receptor and a human IgG1 fragment designed to increase IL-15 activity. Preclinical studies with both HIV and SIV suggest that the drug has potential to reduce virus reservoirs by activating virus from latency and enhancing effector function. We conducted a phase 1 study of N-803 (NCT02191098) in people living with HIV, the primary objective of which was to assess the safety and tolerability of the drug, with an exploratory objective of assessing the impact on peripheral virus reservoirs. ART-suppressed individuals were enrolled into a dose-escalation study of N-803 in four different cohorts (0.3, 1.0, 3.0 and 6.0 mcg kg(-1)). Each cohort received three doses total, separated by at least 1 week. We enrolled 16 individuals, of whom 11 completed all three doses. The maximum tolerated dose was 6.0 mcg kg(-1). The primary clinical adverse events (AEs) reported were injection site rash and adenopathy, and four participants experienced a grade 1 or grade 2 QTc prolongation. No significant laboratory AEs attributable to N-803 were observed. In exploratory analyses, N-803 was associated with proliferation and/or activation of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and natural killer cells that peaked at 4 d after dosing. IFN-gamma, IP-10, MCP-1 and IL-15 increased during treatment. HIV transcription in memory CD4 T cells and intact proviral DNA initially increased after N-803 treatment; however, there was a small but significant decrease in the frequency of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with an inducible HIV provirus that persisted for up to 6 months after therapy. These data suggest that N-803 administration in ART-suppressed people living with HIV is safe and that larger clinical trials are needed to further investigate the effects of N-803 on HIV reservoirs.",FEB,2022,28,2,392,+,,10.1038/s41591-021-01651-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41591-021-01651-9,JAN 2022,35102335,WOS:000750421100003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Airway cell isolates require media that support expansion of cells in a basal state to maintain the capacity for differentiation as well as proper cellular function. By contrast, airway cell differentiation at an air-liquid interface (ALI) requires a distinct medium formulation that typically contains high levels of glucose. Here, we expanded and differentiated human basal cells isolated from the nasal and conducting airway to a mature mucociliary epithelial cell layer at ALI using a medium formulation containing normal resting glucose levels. Of note, bronchial epithelial cells expanded and differentiated in normal resting glucose medium showed insulin-stimulated glucose uptake which was inhibited by high glucose concentrations. Normal glucose containing ALI also enabled differentiation of nasal and tracheal cells that showed comparable electrophysiological profiles when assessed for cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) function and that remained responsive for up to 7 weeks in culture. These data demonstrate that normal glucose containing medium supports differentiation of primary nasal and lung epithelial cells at ALI, is well suited for metabolic studies, and avoids pitfalls associated with exposure to high glucose.",JAN 27,2022,12,1,,,1540,10.1038/s41598-022-05446-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-05446-x,,35087167,WOS:000749198000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Data are needed on the serial use of homologous boosters (same as the primary vaccine) and heterologous boosters (different from the primary vaccine) in fully vaccinated recipients. METHODS In this phase 1-2, open-label clinical trial conducted at 10 sites in the United States, adults who had completed a Covid-19 vaccine regimen at least 12 weeks earlier and had no reported history of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection received a booster injection with one of three vaccines: mRNA-1273 (Moderna) at a dose of 100 mu g, Ad26.COV2.S (Johnson & Johnson-Janssen) at a dose of 5x10(10) virus particles, or BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) at a dose of 30 mu g. The primary end points were safety, reactogenicity, and humoral immunogenicity on trial days 15 and 29. RESULTS Of the 458 participants who were enrolled in the trial, 154 received mRNA-1273, 150 received Ad26.COV2.S, and 153 received BNT162b2 as booster vaccines; 1 participant did not receive the assigned vaccine. Reactogenicity was similar to that reported for the primary series. More than half the recipients reported having injection-site pain, malaise, headache, or myalgia. For all combinations, antibody neutralizing titers against a SARS-CoV-2 D614G pseudovirus increased by a factor of 4 to 73, and binding titers increased by a factor of 5 to 55. Homologous boosters increased neutralizing antibody titers by a factor of 4 to 20, whereas heterologous boosters increased titers by a factor of 6 to 73. Spike-specific T-cell responses increased in all but the homologous Ad26.COV2.S-boosted subgroup. CD8+ T-cell levels were more durable in the Ad26.COV2.S-primed recipients, and heterologous boosting with the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine substantially increased spike-specific CD8+ T cells in the mRNA vaccine recipients. CONCLUSIONS Homologous and heterologous booster vaccines had an acceptable safety profile and were immunogenic in adults who had completed a primary Covid-19 vaccine regimen at least 12 weeks earlier.",MAR 17,2022,386,11,1046,1057,,10.1056/NEJMoa2116414,http://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2116414,JAN 2022,35081293,WOS:000747075300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The risks and outcomes of myocarditis after COVID-19 vaccination are unclear. OBJECTIVE To describe reports of myocarditis and the reporting rates after mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination in the US. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Descriptive study of reports of myocarditis to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) that occurred after mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine administration between December 2020 and August 2021 in 192 405 448 individuals older than 12 years of age in the US; data were processed by VAERS as of September 30, 2021. EXPOSURES Vaccination with BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Reports of myocarditis to VAERS were adjudicated and summarized for all age groups. Crude reporting rates were calculated across age and sex strata. Expected rates of myocarditis by age and sex were calculated using 2017-2019 claims data. For persons younger than 30 years of age, medical record reviews and clinician interviews were conducted to describe dinical presentation, diagnostic test results, treatment, and early outcomes. RESULTS Among 192405 448 persons receiving a total of 354 100 845 mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines during the study period, there were 1991 reports of myocarditis to VAERS and 1626 of these reports met the case definition of myocarditis. Of those with myocarditis, the median age was 21 years (IQR, 16-31 years) and the median time to symptom onset was 2 days (IQR, 1-3 days). Males comprised 82% of the myocarditis cases for whom sex was reported. The crude reporting rates for cases of myocarditis within 7 days after COVID-19 vaccination exceeded the expected rates of myocarditis across multiple age and sex strata. The rates of myocarditis were highest after the second vaccination dose in adolescent males aged 12 to 15 years (70.7 per million doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine), in adolescent males aged 16 to 17 years (105.9 per million doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine), and in young men aged 18 to 24 years (52.4 and 56.3 per million doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine and the mRNA-1273 vaccine, respectively). There were 826 cases of myocarditis among those younger than 30 years of age who had detailed clinical information available; of these cases, 792 of 809 (98%) had elevated troponin levels, 569 of 794 (72%) had abnormal electrocardiogram results, and 223 of 312 (72%) had abnormal cardiac magnetic resonance imaging results. Approximately 96% of persons (784/813) were hospitalized and 87% (577/661) of these had resolution of presenting symptoms by hospital discharge. The most common treatment was nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (589/676; 87%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Based on passive surveillance reporting in the US, the risk of myocarditis after receiving mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines was increased across multiple age and sex strata and was highest after the second vaccination dose in adolescent males and young men. This risk should be considered in the context of the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination.",JAN 25,2022,327,4,331,340,,10.1001/jama.2021.24110,http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.2021.24110,,35076665,WOS:000753055700010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Data were used to estimate HCV genotype distribution and better understand potential sex-specific risk factors that contribute to HCV transmission. HCV genotype distribution by sex and reported risk factors were calculated. We used explanatory logistic regression models stratified by sex to identify behavioral and healthcare-related risk factors for HCV seropositivity, and predictive logistic regression models to identify additional variables that could help predict the presence of infection. Factors associated with HCV seropositivity in explanatory models included, among males, history of injection drug use (IDU) (aOR = 22.4, 95% CI = 12.7, 39.8) and receiving a blood transfusion (aOR = 3.6, 95% CI = 1.4, 8.8), and among females, history of receiving a blood transfusion (aOR = 4.0, 95% CI 2.1, 7.7), kidney dialysis (aOR = 7.3 95% CI 1.5, 35.3) and surgery (aOR = 1.9, 95% CI 1.1, 3.2). The male-specific predictive model additionally identified age, urban residence, and history of incarceration as factors predictive of seropositivity and were used to create a male-specific exposure index (Area under the curve [AUC] = 0.84). The female-specific predictive model had insufficient discriminatory performance to support creating an exposure index (AUC = 0.61). The most prevalent HCV genotype (GT) nationally was GT1b (40.5%), followed by GT3 (34.7%) and GT2 (23.6%).

Short interbirth intervals-the time between successive births-may increase the quantity of offspring but harm offspring quality. In contrast, long interbirth intervals may bolster offspring quality while reducing overall reproductive output. Further research is needed to determine whether this relationship holds among primates, which have intensive parental investment. Using Cox proportional hazards models, we examined the effects of interbirth intervals (short, normal, or long) on infant survivorship using a large demographic dataset (n = 15,852) of captive callitrichine monkeys (marmosets, tamarins, and lion tamarins). In seven of the nine species studied, infants born after short interbirth intervals had significantly higher risks of mortality than infants born after longer interbirth intervals.

Many neuroimaging studies have demonstrated the potential of functional network connectivity patterns estimated from resting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to discriminate groups and predict information about individual subjects. However, the predictive signal present in the spatial heterogeneity of brain connectivity networks is yet to be extensively studied. In this study, we investigate, for the first time, the use of pairwise-relationships between resting-state independent spatial maps to characterize individuals. To do this, we develop a deep Siamese framework comprising three-dimensional convolution neural networks for contrastive learning based on individual-level spatial maps estimated via a fully automated fMRI independent component analysis approach. The proposed framework evaluates whether pairs of spatial networks (e.g., visual network and auditory network) are capable of subject identification and assesses the spatial variability in different network pairs' predictive power in an extensive whole-brain analysis. Our analysis on nearly 12,000 unaffected individuals from the UK Biobank study demonstrates that the proposed approach can discriminate subjects with an accuracy of up to 88% for a single network pair on the test set (best model, after several runs), and 82% average accuracy at the subcortical domain level, notably the highest average domain level accuracy attained. Further investigation of our network's learned features revealed a higher spatial variability in predictive accuracy among younger brains and significantly higher discriminative power among males. In sum, the relationship among spatial networks appears to be both informative and discriminative of individuals and should be studied further as putative brain-based biomarkers.",JAN 21,2022,17,1,,,e0249502,10.1371/journal.pone.0249502,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249502,,35061657,WOS:000791072800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In addition, this study was conducted on a large number of individuals (n = 493), including healthy controls and individuals with cognitive impairment due to diverse underlying etiologies and across different disease stages. Diagnoses included subjective cognitive impairment, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) due to AD, MCI due to other etiologies, dementia due to Alzheimer's diseases (AD), and dementia due to other etiologies (e.g., Vascular Dementia, Frontotemporal Dementia, Lewy Body Dementia, etc.). The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to evaluate cognitive performance across all participants. A participant with a score of less than or equal to 24 was considered cognitively impaired (CI). Compared to cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants, CI participants expressed significantly less positive emotions, more negative emotions, and higher facial expressiveness during the test. In addition, classification analysis revealed that facial emotions expressed during the test allowed effective differentiation of CI from CU participants, largely independent of sex, race, age, education level, mood, and eye movements (derived from an eye-tracking-based digital biomarker for cognitive impairment). No screening methods reliably differentiated the underlying etiology of the cognitive impairment. The findings provide quantitative and comprehensive evidence that the expression of facial emotions is significantly different in people with cognitive impairment, and suggests this may be a useful tool for passive screening of cognitive impairment.",JAN 21,2022,17,1,,,e0262527,10.1371/journal.pone.0262527,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0262527,,35061824,WOS:000791072800139,View Full Record in Web of Science

In Colombia, new graduates provide care for vulnerable populations. The World Health Organization (WHO) Basic Emergency Care (BEC) course trains frontline providers with limited resources in the management of acute illness and injury. While this course may serve medical students as adjunct to current curriculum, its utility in this learner group has not been investigated. This study performs a baseline assessment of knowledge and confidence in emergency management taught in the BEC amongst medical students in Colombia. Methods A validated, cross-sectional survey assessing knowledge and confidence of emergency care congruent with BEC content was electronically administered to graduating medical students across Colombia. Knowledge was evaluated via 15 multiple choice questions and confidence via 13 questions using 100 mm visual analog scales. Mean knowledge and confidence scores were compared across demographics, geography and prior training using Chi-Squared or one-way ANOVA analyses. Results Data were gathered from 468 graduating medical students at 36 institutions. The mean knowledge score was 59.9% +/- 23% (95% CI 57.8-62.0%); the mean confidence score was 59.6 mm +/- 16.7 mm (95% CI 58.1-61.2). Increasing knowledge and confidence scores were associated with prior completion of emergency management training courses (p<0.0001). Conclusion Knowledge and confidence levels of emergency care management for graduating medical students across Colombia demonstrated room for additional, specialized training. Higher scores were seen in groups that had completed emergency care courses.

Methods From 2014-18, fifteen children <2 years old were recruited every week in Matiari, Sindh, and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected. The samples were cultured, and pneumococcus was further serotyped through multiplex PCR at the Aga Khan University Hospital as per the method described by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA. Results Pneumococcus was detected in 2370/3140 (75%) children. Vaccine type (VT) and non-vaccine type (NVT) serotypes were carried by 379 and 1990 children.

Although dot contraction is known to be driven by platelets, how single platelet forces relate to the forces generated by macroscopic clots remains largely unknown. Using our microfabricated high-throughput platelet contraction cytometer, we find that single platelest have an average force of 34 nN (n =10 healthy individuals). However, multiple bulk clot experiments predict a mean single platelets force lower than 0.5 nN. To resolve this discrepancy, we use a mesoscale computational model to probe the mechanism by which individual platelets induce forces in macroscopic clots.

SER-109 is an investigational microbiome therapeutic composed of purified Firmicutes spores for the treatment of recurrent C. difficile infection. METHODS We conducted a phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in which patients who had had three or more episodes of C. difficile infection (inclusive of the qualifying acute episode) received SER-109 or placebo (four capsules daily for 3 days) after standard-of-care antibiotic treatment. The primary efficacy objective was to show superiority of SER-109 as compared with placebo in reducing the risk of C. difficile infection recurrence up to 8 weeks after treatment. Diagnosis by toxin testing was performed at trial entry, and randomization was stratified according to age and antibiotic agent received. Analyses of safety, microbiome engraftment, and metabolites were also performed. RESULTS Among the 281 patients screened, 182 were enrolled. The percentage of patients with recurrence of C. difficile infection was 12% in the SER-109 group and 40% in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.18 to 0.58; P<0.001 for a relative risk of <1.0; P<0.001 for a relative risk of <0.833). SER-109 led to less frequent recurrence than placebo in analyses stratified according to age stratum (relative risk, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.07 to 0.78] for patients <65 years of age and 0.36 [95% CI, 0.18 to 0.72] for those >= 65 years) and antibiotic received (relative risk, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.22 to 0.79] with vancomycin and 0.09 [95% CI, 0.01 to 0.63] with fidaxomicin). Most adverse events were mild to moderate and were gastrointestinal in nature, with similar numbers in the two groups. SER-109 dose species were detected as early as week 1 and were associated with bile-acid profiles that are known to inhibit C. difficile spore germination. CONCLUSIONS In patients with symptom resolution of C. difficile infection after treatment with standard-of-care antibiotics, oral administration of SER-109 was superior to placebo in reducing the risk of recurrent infection.

Physiological stress responses that have been linked to both choking and thriving are well-conserved in primates, but it is unknown whether other primates experience similar effects of pressure. Understanding whether this occurs and, if so, its physiological correlates, will help clarify the evolution and proximate causes of choking in humans. To address this, we trained capuchin monkeys on a computer game that had clearly denoted high- and low-pressure trials, then tested them on trials with the same signals of high pressure, but no difference in task difficulty. Monkeys significantly varied in whether they performed worse or better on high-pressure testing trials and performance improved as monkeys gained experience with performing under pressure. Baseline levels of cortisol were significantly negatively related to performance on high-pressure trials as compared to low-pressure trials. Taken together, this indicates that less experience with pressure may interact with long-term stress to produce choking behavior in early sessions of a task. Our results suggest that performance deficits (or improvements) under pressure are not solely due to human specific factors but are rooted in evolutionarily conserved biological factors.",JAN 19,2022,12,1,,,953,10.1038/s41598-022-04986-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-04986-6,,35046477,WOS:000744620600027,View Full Record in Web of Science

The study included 10 877 infants born at 22-28 weeks' gestational age between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2018, including 2566 infants born before 27 weeks between January 1, 2013. and December 31, 2016, who completed follow-up assessments at 22-26 months' corrected age. The last assessment was completed on August 13, 2019. Outcomes were compared with a similar cohort of infants born in 2008-2012 adjusting for gestational age. EXPOSURES Extremely preterm birth. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Survival and 12 in-hospital morbidities were assessed, including necrotizing enterocolitis, infection, intracranial hemorrhage, retinopathy of prematurity, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Infants were assessed at 22-26 months' corrected age for 12 health and functional outcomes, including neurodevelopment, cerebral palsy, vision, hearing, rehospitalizations, and need for assistive devices. RESULTS The 10 877 infants were 49.0% female and 51.0% male; 78.3% (8495/10848) survived to discharge, an increase from 76.0% in 2008-2012 (adjusted difference, 2.0%; 95% CI, 1.0%-2.9%). Survival to discharge was 10.9% (60/549)for live-born infants at 22 weeks and 94.0% (2267/2412) at 28 weeks. Survival among actively treated infants was 30.0% (60/200) at 22 weeks and 55.8% (535/958) at 23 weeks. All in-hospital morbidities were more likely among infants born at earlier gestational ages. Overall, 8.9% (890/9956) of infants had necrotizing enterocolitis, 2.4% (238/9957) had early-onset infection, 19.9% (1911/9610) had late-onset infection. 14.3% (1386/9705) had severe intracranial hemorrhage. 12.8% (1099/8585) had severe retinopathy of prematurity, and 8.0% (666/8305) had severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Among 2930 surviving infants with gestational ages of 22-26 weeks eligible for follow-up, 2566 (87.6%) were examined. By 2-year follow-up, 8.4% (214/2555) of children had moderate to severe cerebral palsy, 1.5% (38/2555) had bilateral blindness, 2.5% (64/2527) required hearing aids or cochlear implants, 49.9% (1277/2561) had been rehospitalized, and 15.4% (393/2560) required mobility aids or other supportive devices.

How these proteins are able to avoid aberrant activation by cellular RNAs is not fully understood, but adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing has been proposed to limit accumulation of endogenous RNAs that might otherwise cause stimulation of the OAS/RNase L pathway. Here, we aim to uncover whether and how such sequence modifications can restrict the ability of short, defined dsRNAs to activate the single-domain form of OAS, OAS1. Unexpectedly, we find that all tested inosinecontaining dsRNAs have an increased capacity to activate OAS1, whether in a destabilizing (I center dot U) or standard Watson-Crick-like base pairing (I-C) context. Additional variants with strongly destabilizing A center dot C mismatches or stabilizing G-C pairs also exhibit increased capacity to activate OAS1, eliminating helical stability as a factor in the relative ability of the dsRNAs to activate OAS1. Using thermal difference spectra and molecular dynamics simulations, we identify both increased helical dynamics and specific local changes in helical structure as important factors in the capacity of short dsRNAs to activate OAS1. These helical features may facilitate more ready adoption of the distorted OAS1-bound conformation or stabilize important structures to predispose the dsRNA for optimal binding and activation of OAS1. These studies thus reveal the molecular basis for the greater capacity of some short dsRNAs to activate OAS1 in a sequence-independent manner.",JAN 18,2022,119,3,,,e2107111119,10.1073/pnas.2107111119,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2107111119,,35017296,WOS:000748764600019,View Full Record in Web of Science

The purpose of the current study was to describe how clinicians diagnose and treat locally advanced basal cell carcinoma in the United States. Methods This prospective, multicenter, observational registry study included patients with newly diagnosed, Hedgehog pathway inhibitor-naive locally advanced basal cell carcinoma without basal cell carcinoma nevus syndrome (n = 433) treated at 75 US academic and community practices, including dermatology, Mohs surgery, and medical oncology sites. The main outcomes of this study were treatment patterns and associated effectiveness and safety for patients with locally advanced basal cell carcinoma in real-world settings. Results Determination of locally advanced basal cell carcinoma was mainly based on lesion size (79.6% of patients), histopathology (54.3%), extent of involvement (49.0%), and location (46.2%). Within 90 days of determination of locally advanced disease, 115 patients (26.6%) received vismodegib, 251 (58.0%) received surgery/other (non-vismodegib) treatment, and 67 (15.5%) had not yet received treatment (observation). Vismodegib-treated patients had a higher prevalence of high-risk clinical features predictive for locoregional recurrence than those with non-vismodegib treatment or observation. Clinical response rate was 85.1% with vismodegib and 94.9% with non-vismodegib treatment (primarily surgery).

Here we applied mass cytometry by time of flight, single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell V(D)J sequencing, bulk RNA sequencing and bulk T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing to study peripheral blood samples from patients with melanoma treated with anti-PD-1 monotherapy or anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 combination ICIs. By analyzing 93 pre- and early on-ICI blood samples and 3 patient cohorts (n = 27, 26 and 18), we found that 2 pretreatment factors in circulation-activated CD4 memory T cell abundance and TCR diversity-are associated with severe irAE development regardless of organ system involvement.

Parametric mediational g-formula analysis,PLOS ONE,Article,"Background In settings in which there are time-varying confounders affected by previous exposure and a time-varying mediator, natural direct and indirect effects cannot generally be estimated unbiasedly. In the present study, we estimate interventional direct effect and interventional indirect effect of cigarette smoking as a time-varying exposure on coronary heart disease while considering body weight as a time-varying mediator. Methods To address this problem, the parametric mediational g-formula was proposed to estimate interventional direct effect and interventional indirect effect. We used data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis to estimate effect of cigarette smoking on coronary heart disease, considering body weight as time-varying mediator. Results Over a 11-years period, smoking 20 cigarettes per day compared to no smoking directly (not through weight) increased risk of coronary heart disease by an absolute difference of 1.91% (95% CI: 0.49%, 4.14%), and indirectly decreased coronary heart disease risk by -0.02% (95% CI: -0.05%, 0.04%) via change in weight. The total effect was estimated as an absolute 1.89% increase (95% CI: 0.49%, 4.13%). Conclusion The overall absolute impact of smoking to incident coronary heart disease is modest, and we did not discern any important contribution to this effect relayed through changes to bodyweight.

Screening programs must balance the benefit of early detection with the cost of overscreening. Here, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning-based framework for personalized screening, Tempo, and demonstrate its efficacy in the context of breast cancer. We trained our risk-based screening policies on a large screening mammography dataset from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH; USA) and validated this dataset in held-out patients from MGH and external datasets from Emory University (Emory; USA), Karolinska Institute (Karolinska; Sweden) and Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH; Taiwan). Across all test sets, we find that the Tempo policy combined with an image-based artificial intelligence (AI) risk model is significantly more efficient than current regimens used in clinical practice in terms of simulated early detection per screen frequency. Moreover, we show that the same Tempo policy can be easily adapted to a wide range of possible screening preferences, allowing clinicians to select their desired trade-off between early detection and screening costs without training new policies. Finally, we demonstrate that Tempo policies based on AI-based risk models outperform Tempo policies based on less accurate clinical risk models.

Among 445 case patients and 777 controls, of the 180 patients admitted to an ICU, only 2 had been fully vaccinated; all 7 deaths occurred in unvaccinated patients. Background The increasing incidence of pediatric hospitalizations associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) caused by the B.1.617.2 (delta) variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the United States has offered an opportunity to assess the real-world effectiveness of the BNT162b2 messenger RNA vaccine in adolescents between 12 and 18 years of age. Methods We used a case-control, test-negative design to assess vaccine effectiveness against Covid-19 resulting in hospitalization, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of life-supporting interventions (mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), or death. Between July 1 and October 25, 2021, we screened admission logs for eligible case patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 at 31 hospitals in 23 states. We estimated vaccine effectiveness by comparing the odds of antecedent full vaccination (two doses of BNT162b2) in case patients as compared with two hospital-based control groups: patients who had Covid-19-like symptoms but negative results on testing for SARS-CoV-2 (test-negative) and patients who did not have Covid-19-like symptoms (syndrome-negative). Results A total of 445 case patients and 777 controls were enrolled. Overall, 17 case patients (4%) and 282 controls (36%) had been fully vaccinated. Of the case patients, 180 (40%) were admitted to the ICU, and 127 (29%) required life support; only 2 patients in the ICU had been fully vaccinated. The overall effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine against hospitalization for Covid-19 was 94% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90 to 96); the effectiveness was 95% (95% CI, 91 to 97) among test-negative controls and 94% (95% CI, 89 to 96) among syndrome-negative controls. The effectiveness was 98% against ICU admission and 98% against Covid-19 resulting in the receipt of life support. All 7 deaths occurred in patients who were unvaccinated. Conclusions Among hospitalized adolescent patients, two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine were highly effective against Covid-19-related hospitalization and ICU admission or the receipt of life support.

OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that a 6-week duration of anticoagulant therapy for provoked venous thromboembolism is noninferior to a conventional 3-month therapy duration in patients younger than 21 years of age. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized clinical trial involving 417 patients younger than 21 years of age with acute, provoked venous thromboembolism enrolled at 42 centers in 5 countries from 2008-2021. The main exclusions were severe anticoagulant deficiencies or prior venous thromboembolism. Patients without persistent antiphospholipid antibodies and whose thrombi were resolved or not completely occlusive upon repeat imaging at 6 weeks after diagnosis underwent randomization. The final visit for the primary end points occurred in January 2021. INTERVENTIONS Total duration for anticoagulant therapy of 6 weeks (n = 207) vs 3 months (n = 210) for provoked venous thromboembolism. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary efficacy and safety end points were centrally adjudicated symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism and clinically relevant bleeding events within 1 year blinded to treatment group. The primary analysis was noninferiority in the per-protocol population. The noninferiority boundary incorporated a bivariate trade-off that induded an absolute increase of 0% in symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism with an absolute risk reduction of 4% in clinically relevant bleeding events (1 of 3 points on the bivariate noninferiority boundary curve). RESULTS Among 417 randomized patients, 297 (median age, 8.3 [range, 0.04-20.9] years; 49% female) met criteria for the primary per-protocol population analysis. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for the 1-year cumulative incidence of the primary efficacy outcome was 0.66% (95% CI, 0%-1.95%) in the 6-week anticoagulant therapy group and 0.70% (95% CI, 0%-2.07%) in the 3-month anticoagulant therapy group, and for the primary safety outcome, the incidence was 0.65% (95% CI, 0%1.91%) and 0.70% (95% CI, 0%-2.06%). Based on absolute risk differences in recurrent venous thromboembolism and clinically relevant bleeding events between groups, noninferiority was demonstrated. Adverse events occurred in 26% of patients in the 6-week anticoagulant therapy group and in 32% of patients in the 3-month anticoagulant therapy group; the most common adverse event was fever (1.9% and 3.4%, respectively).

Here, we characterize the physiology of Porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontal pathogen, in its native environment using 93 published metatranscriptomic datasets from periodontally healthy and diseased individuals. P. gingivalis transcripts were more abundant in samples from periodontally diseased patients but only above 0.1% relative abundance in one-third of diseased samples. During human infection, P. gingivalis highly expressed genes encoding virulence factors such as fimbriae and gingipains (proteases) and genes involved in growth and metabolism, indicating that P. gingivalis is actively growing during disease. A quantitative framework for assessing the accuracy of model systems showed that 96% of P. gingivalis genes were expressed similarly in periodontitis and in vitro midlogarithmic growth, while significantly fewer genes were expressed similarly in periodontitis and in vitro stationary phase cultures (72%) or in a murine abscess infection model (85%). This high conservation in gene expression between periodontitis and logarithmic laboratory growth is driven by overall low variance in P. gingivalis gene expression, relative to other pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Together, this study presents strong evidence for the use of simple test tube growth as the gold standard model for studying P. gingivalis biology, providing biological relevance for the thousands of laboratory experiments performed with logarithmic phase P. gingivalis. Furthermore, this work highlights the need to quantitatively assess the accuracy of model systems.",JAN 11,2022,119,2,,,e2116637119,10.1073/pnas.2116637119,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2116637119,,34992142,WOS:000748066700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

As a deintensification strategy, we studied primary transoral surgery (TOS) and reduced postoperative radiation therapy (RT) in intermediate-risk HPV+ OPC. METHODS E3311 is a phase II randomized trial of reduced- or standard-dose postoperative RT for resected stage III-IVa (American Joint Committee on Cancer-seventh edition) HPV+ OPC, determined by pathologic parameters. Primary goals were feasibility of prospective multi-institutional study of TOS for HPV+ OPC, and oncologic efficacy (2-year progression-free survival) of TOS and adjuvant therapy in intermediate-risk patients after resection. TOS plus 50 Gy was considered promising if the lower limit of the exact 90% binomial confidence intervals exceeded 85%. Quality of life and swallowing were measured by functional assessment of cancer therapy-head and neck and MD Anderson Dysphagia Index. RESULTS Credentialed surgeons performed TOS for 495 patients. Eligible and treated patients were assigned as follows: arm A (low risk, n = 38) enrolled 11%, intermediate risk arms B (50 Gy, n = 100) or C (60 Gy, n = 108) randomly allocated 58%, and arm D (high risk, n = 113) enrolled 31%. With a median 35.2-month follow-up for 359 evaluable (eligible and treated) patients, 2-year progression-free survival Kaplan-Meier estimate is 96.9% (90% CI, 91.9 to 100) for arm A (observation), 94.9% (90% CI, 91.3 to 98.6]) for arm B (50 Gy), 96.0% (90% CI, 92.8 to 99.3) for arm C (60 Gy), and 90.7% (90% CI, 86.2 to 95.4) for arm D (66 Gy plus weekly cisplatin).

Due to the world-class performances and relatively fast race finishes of these athletes, many people assume that running-prostheses provide users an unfair advantage over biologically legged competitors during long sprint races. These assumptions have led athletics governing bodies to prohibit the use of running-prostheses in sanctioned non-amputee (NA) competitions, such as at the Olympics. However, here we show that no athlete with bilateral leg amputations using running-prostheses, including the fastest such athlete, exhibits a single 400 m running performance metric that is better than those achieved by NA athletes. Specifically, the best experimentally measured maximum running velocity and sprint endurance profile of athletes with prosthetic legs are similar to, but not better than those of NA athletes. Further, the best experimentally measured initial race acceleration (from 0 to 20 m), maximum velocity around curves, and velocity at aerobic capacity of athletes with prosthetic legs were 40%, 1-3% and 19% slower compared to NA athletes, respectively. Therefore, based on these 400 m performance metrics, use of prosthetic legs during 400 m running races is not unequivocally advantageous compared to the use of biological legs.",JAN 5,2022,9,1,,,211799,10.1098/rsos.211799,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.211799,,35070345,WOS:000738566000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

B cell reprograming may be scientifically and therapeutically useful, but current approaches limit B cell repertoire diversity and disrupt the organization of the heavy-chain locus. A more diverse and physiologic B cell repertoire targeting a key HIV-1 epitope could facilitate evaluation of vaccines designed to elicit bNAbs, help identify more potent and bioavailable bNAb variants, or directly enhance viral control in vivo. Here we address the challenges of generating such a repertoire by replacing the heavychain CDR3 (HCDR3) regions of primary human B cells. To do so, we identified and utilized an uncharacterized Cas12a ortholog that recognizes PAM motifs present in human JH genes. We also optimized the design of 200 nucleotide homologydirected repair templates (HDRT) by minimizing the required 30-50 deletion of the HDRT-complementary strand. Using these techniques, we edited primary human B cells to express a hemagglutinin epitope tag and the HCDR3 regions of the bNAbs PG9 and PG16. Those edited with bNAb HCDR3 efficiently bound trimeric HIV-1 antigens, implying they could affinity mature in vivo in response to the same antigens. This approach generates diverse B cell repertoires recognizing a key HIV-1 neutralizing epitope.",JAN 5,2022,30,1,184,197,,10.1016/j.ymthe.2021.10.027,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymthe.2021.10.027,,34740791,WOS:000744579600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

L.; Loughrey, David",,Non-liver mRNA Delivery Published as part of the Accounts of Chemical Research special issue mRNA Therapeutics,ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH,Review,"CONSPECTUS: mRNA drugs can preempt infectious disease and treat Mendelian disorders, such as sickle cell anemia, muscular dystrophy, and cystic fibrosis, as well as autoimmunity and cancer. The three major therapeutic areas for which mRNA delivery is currently being explored are antigen production, including the COVID-19 vaccine, protein replacement therapy, and genome engineering. It was demonstrated 30 years ago that introducing in vitro transcribed mRNA intramuscularly results in detectable protein expression for specific antigens protecting against the likes of influenza and cancer. Utilizing mRNA as a therapeutic modality, however, is challenging. mRNA is large and anionic and, as a result, cannot passively diffuse across the negatively charged plasma membrane. In addition, RNases present in the bloodstream and tissues rapidly degrade mRNA, and its administration induces the innate immune response. In consequence, lipid-, polymer-, dendrimer-, and natural membrane-based mRNA drug delivery systems have been developed to deliver mRNA to target cells. Significant efforts and investments have been made to translate some of these systems into the clinic. Specifically, systemically administered lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have delivered mRNA to the liver, and intramuscularly administered LNPs have delivered mRNA to immune cells to protect against coronavirus disease of 2019. However, clinically relevant delivery in non-liver tissues such as the spleen, lungs, heart, eye, central nervous system, and lymphatics requires improved drug delivery systems. In this Account, we provide an overview of key advances that have led us to Food and Drug Administration approval for the Pfizer/ BioNTech mRNA-based vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 and Emergency Use Authorization for the Moderna mRNA-based vaccine against the same disease, and we explain how these developments will contribute to the clinical translation of mRNA therapeutics targeted outside of the liver. We first focus on the chemical modifications and sequence optimization that can improve the potency of mRNA, resulting in greatly improved pharmacokinetics. After detailing what makes an ideal mRNA payload, we review drug delivery systems used to deliver the payload into target cells. We describe efforts to reduce clearance by the liver, a key obstacle to the development of non-liver therapies. We then consider recent examples of nanoparticles that have delivered mRNA to non-liver tissues. Finally, we discuss current clinical mRNA programs, focusing on the COVID vaccines and highlighting lessons that may be applied to future mRNA drugs.",JAN 4,2022,55,1,13,23,,10.1021/acs.accounts.1c00601,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.accounts.1c00601,,,WOS:000744140200003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The purpose of this study was to determine if the State of New Jersey had a supply of registered nurses (RNs) that was sufficient to meet the needs of hospitalized patients during a natural disaster - Hurricane Sandy. Methods Secondary data were used to forecast the demand and supply of New Jersey RNs during Hurricane Sandy. Data sources from November 2011 and 2012 included the State Inpatient Databases (SID), American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey on hospital characteristics and staffing data from New Jersey Department of Health. Three models were used to estimate the RN shortage for each hospital, which was the difference between the demand and supply of RN full-time equivalents. Results Data were available on 66 New Jersey hospitals, more than half of which experienced a shortage of RNs during Hurricane Sandy. For hospitals with a RN shortage in ICUs, a 20% increase in observed RN supply was needed to meet the demand; and a 10% increase in observed RN supply was necessary to meet the demand for hospitals with a RN shortage in non-ICUs. Conclusion Findings from this study suggest that many hospitals in New Jersey had a shortage of RNs during Hurricane Sandy.

However, little evidence is available from randomised trials to support the efficacy of interventions targeting the F and E components of the strategy. We aimed to determine whether an integrated water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) intervention prevents the transmission of trachoma. Methods The WASH Upgrades for Health in Amhara (WUHA) was a two-arm, parallel-group, cluster-randomised trial in 40 rural communities in Wag Hemra Zone (Amhara Region, Ethiopia) that had been treated with 7 years of annual mass azithromycin distributions. The randomisation unit was the school catchment area. All households within a 1.5 km radius of a potential water point within the catchment area (as determined by the investigators) were eligible for inclusion. Clusters were randomly assigned (at a 1:1 ratio) to receive a WASH intervention either immediately (intervention) or delayed until the conclusion of the trial (control), in the absence of concurrent antibiotic distributions. Given the nature of the intervention, participants and field workers could not be masked, but laboratory personnel were masked to treatment allocation. The WASH intervention consisted of both hygiene infrastructure improvements (namely, construction of a community water point) and hygiene promotion by government, school, and community leaders, which were implemented at the household, school, and community levels. Hygiene promotion focused on two simple messages: to use soap and water to wash your or your child's face, and to always use a latrine for defecation. The primary outcome was the cluster-level prevalence of ocular chlamydia, measured annually using conjunctival swabs in a random sample of children aged 0-5 years from each cluster at 12, 24, and 36 month timepoints. Analyses were done in an intention-to-treat manner. This trial is ongoing and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02754583. Findings Between Nov 9, 2015, and March 5, 2019, 40 of 44 dusters assessed for eligibility were enrolled and randomly allocated to the trial groups (20 dusters each, with 7636 people from 1751 households in the intervention group and 9821 people from 2211 households in the control group at baseline). At baseline, ocular chlamydia prevalence among children aged 0-5 years was 11% (95% CI 6 to 16) in the WASH group and 11% (5 to 18) in the control group. At month 36, ocular chlamydia prevalence had increased in both groups, to 32% (24 to 41) in the WASH group and 31% (21 to 41) in the control group (risk difference across three annual monitoring visits, after adjustment for prevalence at baseline: 3.7 percentage points; 95% CI -4 .9 to 12.4; p=0.40). No adverse events were reported in either group. Interpretation An integrated WASH intervention addressing the F and E components of the SAFE strategy did not prevent an increase in prevalence of ocular chlamydia following cessation of antibiotics in an area with hyperendemic trachoma. The impact of WASH in the presence of annual mass azithromycin distributions is currently being studied in a follow-up trial of the 40 study clusters. Continued antibiotic distributions will probably be important in areas with persistent trachoma. Copyright (C) 2021 The Author(s).

Approximately 85% of cases are primary CBP, for which peripheral etiology cannot be identified, and maintenance factors include fear, avoidance, and beliefs that pain indicates injury. OBJECTIVE To test whether a psychological treatment (pain reprocessing therapy [PRT]) aiming to shift patients' beliefs about the causes and threat value of pain provides substantial and durable pain relief from primary CBP and to investigate treatment mechanisms. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This randomized clinical trial with longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and 1-year follow-up assessment was conducted in a university research setting from November 2017 to August 2018, with 1-year follow-up completed by November 2019. Clinical and fMRI data were analyzed from January 2019 to August 2020. The study compared PRT with an open-label placebo treatment and with usual care in a community sample. INTERVENTIONS Participants randomized to PRT participated in 1 telehealth session with a physician and 8 psychological treatment sessions over 4 weeks. Treatment aimed to help patients reconceptualize their pain as due to nondangerous brain activity rather than peripheral tissue injury, using a combination of cognitive, somatic, and exposure-based techniques. Participants randomized to placebo received an open-label subcutaneous saline injection in the back; participants randomized to usual care continued their routine, ongoing care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES One-week mean back pain intensity score (0 to 10) at posttreatment, pain beliefs, and fMRI measures of evoked pain and resting connectivity. RESULTS At baseline, 151 adults (54% female; mean [SD] age, 41.1[15.6] years) reported mean (SD) pain of low to moderate severity (mean [SD] pain intensity, 4.10 [1.26] of 10; mean [SD] disability, 23.34[10.12] of 100) and mean (SD) pain duration of 10.0 (8.9) years. Large group differences in pain were observed at posttreatment, with a mean (SD) pain score of 1.18 (1.24) in the PRT group, 2.84 (1.64) in the placebo group, and 3.13 (1.45) in the usual care group. Hedges g was -1.14 for PRT vs placebo and -1.74 for PRT vs usual care (P < .001). Of 151 total participants, 33 of 50 participants (66%) randomized to PRT were pain-free or nearly pain-free at posttreatment (reporting a pain intensity score of 0 or 1 of 10), compared with 10 of 51participants (20%) randomized to placebo and 5 of 50 participants (10%) randomized to usual care. Treatment effects were maintained at 1-year follow-up, with a mean (SD) pain score of 1.51(1.59) in the PRT group, 2.79 (1.78) in the placebo group, and 3.00 (1.77) in the usual care group. Hedges g was -0.70 for PRT vs placebo (P = .001) and -1.05 for PRT vs usual care (P < .001) at 1-year follow-up. Longitudinal fMRI showed (1) reduced responses to evoked back pain in the anterior midcingulate and the anterior prefrontal cortex for PRT vs placebo; (2) reduced responses in the anterior insula for PRT vs usual care; (3) increased resting connectivity from the anterior prefrontal cortex and the anterior insula to the primary somatosensory cortex for PRT vs both control groups; and (4) increased connectivity from the anterior midcingulate to the precuneus for PRT vs usual care.

Here, we present the final analysis from iNNOVATE. METHODS Patients had confirmed symptomatic WM, either previously untreated or previously treated; patients with prior rituximab had at least a minor response to their last rituximab-based regimen. Patients were randomly assigned to once-daily ibrutinib 420 mg plus rituximab or placebo plus rituximab (n = 75 per arm). The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included response rate, time to next treatment, hemoglobin improvement, overall survival, and safety. RESULTS With a median follow-up of 50 (range, 0.5-63) months, median (95% CI) PFS was not reached (57.7 months to not evaluable) with ibrutinib-rituximab versus 20.3 months (13.0 to 27.6) with placebo-rituximab (hazard ratio, 0.250; P < .0001). PFS benefit was regardless of prior treatment status, MYD88 and CXCR4 mutation status, or key patient characteristics. Higher response rates (partial response or better) were observed with ibrutinib-rituximab (76% v 31% with placebo-rituximab; P < .0001) and were sustained over time. Median time to next treatment was not reached with ibrutinib-rituximab versus 18 months with placebo-rituximab. More patients receiving ibrutinib-rituximab versus placebo-rituximab had sustained hemoglobin improvement (77% v 43%; P < .0001). Median overall survival was not reached in either arm. Ibrutinib-rituximab maintained a manageable safety profile; the prevalence of grade >= 3 adverse events of clinical interest generally decreased over time.

There were also reports of monocytes transforming to microglia-like cells. Here we explore the roles of monocytes in microglia ontogeny and the pathogenesis of neonatal cerebral hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury in mice. Methods: We used three genetic methods to track the development of monocytes, including CX3CR1(GFP)(/+); CCR2(RFP/)(+) reporter mice, adoptive transfer of GFP +/- monocytes, and fate-mapping with CCR2-CreER mice, in neonatal mouse brains with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.3 mg/kg)-sensitized Vannucci HI. We also used genetic (CCR2(RFP/)(RFP), CCR2 knockout) and pharmacological methods (RS102895, a CCR2 antagonist) to test the roles of monocytic influx in LPS/HI brain injury. Results: CCR2(+) monocytes entered the late-embryonic brains via choroid plexus, but rapidly became CX3CR1(+ )amoeboid microglial cells (AMCs). The influx of CCR2(+) monocytes declined after birth, but recurred after HI or LPS-sensitized HI (LPS/HI) brain injury, particularly in the hippocampus. The CCR2-CreER-based fate-mapping showed that CCR2(+) monocytes became CD68(+) TNF alpha(+) macrophages within 4 d after LPS/HI, and maintained as TNF alpha(+) MHCII+ macrophages or persisted as Tmem119(+) Sall1(+) P2RY12(+) ramified microglia for at least five months after injury. Genetic deletion of the chemokine receptor CCR2 markedly diminished monocytic influx, the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and brain damage. Post-LPS/HI application of RS102895 also reduced inflammatory responses and brain damage, leading to better cognitive functions. Conclusion: These results suggest that monocytes promote acute inflammatory responses and may become pathological microglia long after the neonatal LPS/HI insult. Further, blocking the influx of monocytes may be a potential therapy for neonatal brain injury.",,2022,12,2,512,529,,10.7150/thno.64033,http://dx.doi.org/10.7150/thno.64033,,34976198,WOS:000740076300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, hPSC-CMs differentiated in conventional two-dimensional systems are structurally and functionally immature. Moreover, these differentiation systems generate predominantly one type of cell. Since the heart includes not only CMs but other cell types, such monolayer cultures have limitations in simulating the native heart. Accordingly, three-dimensional (3D) cardiac tissues have been developed as a better platform by including various cardiac cell types and extracellular matrices. Two advances were made for 3D cardiac tissue generation. One type is engineered heart tissues (EHTs), which are constructed by 3D cell culture of cardiac cells using an engineering technology. This system provides a convenient real-time analysis of cardiac function, as well as a precise control of the input/output flow and mechanical/electrical stimulation. The other type is cardiac organoids, which are formed through self-organization of differentiating cardiac lineage cells from hPSCs. While mature cardiac organoids are more desirable, at present only primitive forms of organoids are available.

Due to the growth of tools and techniques for collecting data, information on the condition of these systems is more widely available. While there are a variety of approaches for mining and assessing data, there is a need for methods to detect latent characteristics in ecosystems linked to temporal and spatial patterns of change. Resilience-based approaches have been effective at not only identifying environmental change but also providing warning in advance of critical transitions in social-ecological systems (SES). In this study, we examine the usefulness of one such method, Fisher Information (FI) for spatiotemporal analysis. FI is used to assess patterns in data and has been established as an effective tool for capturing complex system dynamics to include regimes and regime shifts. We employed FI to assess the biophysical condition of eighty-five Swedish lakes from 1996-2018. Results showed that FI captured spatiotemporal changes in the Swedish lakes and identified distinct spatial patterns above and below the Limes Norrlandicus, a hard ecotone boundary which separates northern and southern ecoregions in Sweden.

The majority of nucleosome assembly occurs during DNA replication when these core histones are produced en masse to accommodate the nascent genome. In addition, there are a number of nonallelic sequence variants of H2A and H3 in particular, known as histone variants, that can be incorporated into nucleosomes in a targeted and replication-independent manner. By virtue of their sequence divergence from the replication-coupled histones, these histone variants can impart unique properties onto the nucleosomes they occupy and thereby influence transcription and epigenetic states, DNA repair, chromosome segregation, and other nuclear processes in ways that profoundly affect plant biology. In this review, we discuss the evolutionary origins of these variants in plants, their known roles in chromatin, and their impacts on plant development and stress responses. We focus on the individual and combined roles of histone variants in transcriptional regulation within euchromatic and heterochromatic genome regions. Finally, we highlight gaps in our understanding of plant variants at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels, and we propose new directions for study in the field of plant histone variants.",,2022,73,,149,172,,10.1146/annurev-arplant-070221-050044,http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-arplant-070221-050044,,35167758,WOS:000799211600007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Algorithmic modeling techniques were leveraged to discern the extent to which the 14 IBQ-R subscale scores accurately classified participating children as boys (n = 2,298) and girls (n = 2,093), and into three age groups: youngest (< 24 weeks; n = 1,102), mid-range (24 to 48 weeks; n = 2,557), and oldest (> 48 weeks; n = 779). Additionally, simultaneous classification into age and gender categories was performed, providing an opportunity to consider the extent to which gender differences in temperament are informed by infant age. Results indicated that overall age group classification was more accurate than child gender models, suggesting that age-related changes are more salient than gender differences in early childhood with respect to temperament attributes. However, gender-based classification was superior in the oldest age group, suggesting temperament differences between boys and girls are accentuated with development.

Here, we aimed to externally validate the performance of the UVA score using previously collected data from patients hospitalized with acute infection in Rwanda. MethodsWe performed a secondary analysis of data collected from adults >= 18 years with acute infection admitted to Gitwe District Hospital in Rwanda from 2016 until 2017. We calculated the UVA score from the time of admission and at 72 hours after admission. We also calculated quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment (qSOFA) and modified early warning scores (MEWS). We calculated amalgamated qSOFA scores by inserting UVA cut-offs into the qSOFA score, and modified UVA scores by removing the HIV criterion. The performance of each score determined by the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) was the primary outcome measure. ResultsWe included 573 hospitalized adult patients with acute infection of whom 40 (7%) died in-hospital. The admission AUCs (95% confidence interval [CI]) for the prediction of mortality by the scores were: UVA, 0.77 (0.68-0.85); modified UVA, 0.77 (0.68-0.85); qSOFA, 0.66 (0.56-0.75), amalgamated qSOFA, 0.71 (0.61-0.80); and MEWS, 0.74 (0.64, 0.83). The positive predictive values (95% CI) of the scores at commonly used cut-offs were: UVA >4, 0.35 (0.15-0.59); modified UVA >4, 0.35 (0.15-0.59); qSOFA >1, 0.14 (0.07-0.24); amalgamated qSOFA >1, 0.44 (0.20-0.70); and MEWS >5, 0.14 (0.08-0.22).

Prodrugs-which are converted into a pharmacologically active compound after administration-represent a growing class of therapeutics for treating bacterial infections but are understudied in the context of antibiotic failure. We hypothesize that strategies that rely on pathogen-specific pathways for prodrug conversion are susceptible to competing rates of prodrug activation and bacterial replication, which could lead to treatment escape and failure. Here, we construct a mathematical model of prodrug kinetics to predict rate-dependent conditions under which bacteria escape prodrug treatment. From this model, we derive a dimensionless parameter we call the Bacterial Advantage Heuristic (BAH) that predicts the transition between prodrug escape and successful treatment across a range of time scales (1-10(4) h), bacterial carrying capacities (5 x 10(4)-10(5) CFU/mu l), and Michaelis constants (K-M = 0.747-7.47 mM). To verify these predictions in vitro, we use two models of bacteria-prodrug competition: (i) an antimicrobial peptide hairpin that is enzymatically activated by bacterial surface proteases and (ii) a thiomaltose-conjugated trimethoprim that is internalized by bacterial maltodextrin transporters and hydrolyzed by free thiols. We observe that prodrug failure occurs at BAH values above the same critical threshold predicted by the model. Furthermore, we demonstrate two examples of how failing prodrugs can be rescued by decreasing the BAH below the critical threshold via (i) substrate design and (ii) nutrient control. We envision such dimensionless parameters serving as supportive pharmacokinetic quantities that guide the design and administration of prodrug therapeutics.",JAN,2022,18,1,,,e10495,10.15252/msb.202110495,http://dx.doi.org/10.15252/msb.202110495,,35005851,WOS:000749669200004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Currently, the diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on information gleaned from the patient's self-report, what the clinician observes directly, and what the clinician gathers from collateral informants, but these elements are prone to subjectivity. Utilizing computer vision to measure facial expressions is a promising approach to adding more objectivity in the evaluation and diagnosis of schizophrenia. MethodWe conducted a systematic review using PubMed and Google Scholar. Relevant publications published before (including) December 2021 were identified and evaluated for inclusion. The objective was to conduct a systematic review of computer vision for facial behavior analysis in schizophrenia studies, the clinical findings, and the corresponding data processing and machine learning methods. ResultsSeventeen studies published between 2007 to 2021 were included, with an increasing trend in the number of publications over time. Only 14 articles used interviews to collect data, of which different combinations of passive to evoked, unstructured to structured interviews were used. Various types of hardware were adopted and different types of visual data were collected. Commercial, open-access, and in-house developed models were used to recognize facial behaviors, where frame-level and subject-level features were extracted. Statistical tests and evaluation metrics varied across studies. The number of subjects ranged from 2-120, with an average of 38. Overall, facial behaviors appear to have a role in estimating diagnosis of schizophrenia and psychotic symptoms. When studies were evaluated with a quality assessment checklist, most had a low reporting quality.

We aimed to estimate the benefit of thrombectomy overall and in prespecified subgroups through individual patient data meta-analysis. Methods We did a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis between Jan 1, 2010, and March 1, 2021, of randomised controlled trials of endovascular stroke therapy. In the Analysis Of Pooled Data From Randomized Studies Of Thrombectomy More Than 6 Hours After Last Known Well (AURORA) collaboration, the primary outcome was disability on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90 days, analysed by ordinal logistic regression. Key safety outcomes were symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage and mortality within 90 days. Findings Patient level data from 505 individuals (n=266 intervention, n=239 control; mean age 68.6 years [SD 13.7], 259 [51.3%] women) were included from six trials that met inclusion criteria of 17 screened published randomised trials. Primary outcome analysis showed a benefit of thrombectomy with an unadjusted common odds ratio (OR) of 2.42 (95% CI 1.76-3.33; p<0.0001) and an adjusted common OR (for age, gender, baseline stroke severity, extent of infarction on baseline head CT, and time from onset to random assignment) of 2.54 (1.83-3.54; p<0.0001). Thrombectomy was associated with higher rates of independence in activities of daily living (mRS 0-2) than best medical therapy alone (122 [45.9%] of 266 vs 46 [19.3%] of 238; p<0.0001). No significant difference between intervention and control groups was found when analysing either 90-day mortality (44 [16.5%] of 266 vs 46 [19.3%] of 238) or symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (14 [5.3%] of 266 vs eight [3.3%] of 239). No heterogeneity of treatment effect was noted across subgroups defined by age, gender, baseline stroke severity, vessel occlusion site, baseline Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score, and mode of presentation; treatment effect was stronger in patients randomly assigned within 12-24 h (common OR 5.86 [95% CI 3.14-10.94]) than those randomly assigned within 6-12 h (1.76 [1.18-2.62]; p interaction=0.0087). Interpretation These findings strengthen the evidence for benefit of endovascular thrombectomy in patients with evidence of reversible cerebral ischaemia across the 6-24 h time window and are relevant to clinical practice. Our findings suggest that in these patients, thrombectomy should not be withheld on the basis of mode of presentation or of the point in time of presentation within the 6-24 h time window.

Although most patients are diagnosed in the newborn period, an increasing number of patients are presenting later in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Despite hypoxemia and hypercapnia, patients do not manifest clinical features of respiratory distress during sleep and wakefulness. CCHS is a lifelong disorder. Patients require assisted ventilation throughout their life delivered by positive pressure ventilation via tracheostomy, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, and/or diaphragm pacing. At different ages, patients may prefer to change their modality of assisted ventilation. This requires an individualized and coordinated multidisciplinary approach. Additional clinical features of CCHS that may present at different ages and require periodic evaluations or interventions include Hirschsprung's disease, gastrointestinal dysmotility, neural crest tumors, cardiac arrhythmias, and neurodevelopmental delays. Despite an established PHOX2B genotype and phenotype correlation, patients have variable and heterogeneous clinical manifestations requiring the formulation of an individualized plan of care based on collaboration between the pulmonologist, otolaryngologist, cardiologist, anesthesiologist, gastroenterologist, sleep medicine physician, geneticist, surgeon, oncologist, and respiratory therapist.

We quantified the rate of RSV-associated hospitalization in adults by CHF status using population-based surveillance in the United States. MethodsPopulation-based surveillance for RSV (RSV-NET) was performed in 35 counties in seven sites during two respiratory seasons (2015-2017) from October 1-April 30. Adults (>= 18 years) admitted to a hospital within the surveillance catchment area with laboratory-confirmed RSV identified by clinician-directed testing were included. Presence of underlying CHF was determined by medical chart abstraction. We calculated overall and age-stratified (<65 years and >= 65 years) RSV-associated hospitalization rates by CHF status. Estimates were adjusted for age and the under-detection of RSV. We also report rate differences (RD) and rate ratios (RR) by comparing the rates for those with and without CHF. Results2042 hospitalized RSV cases with CHF status recorded were identified. Most (60.2%, n = 1230) were >= 65 years, and 28.3% (n = 577) had CHF. The adjusted RSV hospitalization rate was 26.7 (95% CI: 22.2, 31.8) per 10,000 population in adults with CHF versus 3.3 (95% CI: 3.3, 3.3) per 10,000 in adults without CHF (RR: 8.1, 95% CI: 6.8, 9.7; RD: 23.4, 95% CI: 18.9, 28.5).

This study examines the association between individual, neighborhood, and school-level influences during adolescence on young adult blood pressure. MethodsData were analyzed from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (1994-1995 aged 11-18 and 2007-2008 aged 24-32). We categorized hypertension as systolic blood pressure >= 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure >= 90 mm Hg. Secondary outcomes included continuous systolic and diastolic blood pressure. We fit a series of cross-classified multilevel models to estimate the associations between young adulthood hypertension with individual-level, school-level, and neighborhood-level factors during adolescence (i.e., fixed effects) and variance attributable to each level (i.e., random effects). Models were fit using Bayesian estimation procedures. For linear models, intra-class correlations (ICC) are reported for random effects. ResultsThe final sample included 13,911 participants in 128 schools and 1,917 neighborhoods. Approximately 51% (7,111) young adults were hypertensive. Individual-level characteristics-particularly older ages, Non-Hispanic Black race, Asian race, male sex, BMI, and current smoking-were associated with increased hypertension. Non-Hispanic Black (OR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.03-1.42) and Asian (OR = 1.28; 95% CI: 1.02-1.62) students had higher odds of hypertension compared to non-Hispanic White students. At the school level, hypertension was associated with the percentage of non-Hispanic White students (OR for 10% higher = 1.06; 95% CI: 1.01-1.09). Adjusting for individual, school, and neighborhood predictors attenuated the ICC for both the school (from 1.4 null to 0.9 fully-adjusted) and neighborhood (from 0.4 to 0.3). ConclusionWe find that adolescents' schools and individual-level factors influence young adult hypertension, more than neighborhoods.

The objective of this study is to assess the relationship, if any, between individual votes and Panel recommendations and: (1) the composition of Panels, specifically the expertise and demographic features of individual members; or (2) Panel members' propensity to speak during Panel deliberations. MethodsThis was a retrospective cohort study of routinely collected data from voting members of MDAC panels convened between January 2011 to June 2016 to consider premarket approval. Data sources were verbatim transcripts available publicly from the FDA. Number of words spoken, directionality of votes on device approval, profession, and demographics were collected. Results658,954 words spoken by 536 members during 49 meetings of 11 Panels were analyzed. Based on multivariate analysis, biostatisticians spoke more (+373 words; P = 0.0002), and women (-187 words; P = 0.0184) and other non-physician voting members less (-213 words; P = 0.0306), than physicians. Speaking more was associated with abstaining (P = 0.0179), and with voting against the majority (P = 0.0153). Non-physician, non-biostatistician members (P = 0.0109), and those having attended more meetings as a voting member (P = 0.0249) were more likely to vote against approval.

In a context of pervasive policy neglect, research on nutrition during adolescence specifically has been underinvested, compared with such research in other age groups, which has inhibited the development of adolescent-responsive nutritional policies. One consequence has been the absence of an integrated perspective on adolescent growth and development, and the role that nutrition plays. Through late childhood and early adolescence, nutrition has a formative role in the timing and pattern of puberty, with consequences for adult height, muscle, and fat mass accrual, as well as risk of non-communicable diseases in later life.

Here, we report a label-free optical strategy using Raman spectroscopy and machine learning to identify distinct metastatic phenotypes observed in tumors formed by isogenic murine breast cancer cell lines of progressively increasing metastatic propensities. Methods: We employed the 4T1 isogenic panel of murine breast cancer cells to grow tumors of varying metastatic potential and acquired label-free spectra using a fiber probe-based portable Raman spectroscopy system. We used MCR-ALS and random forests classifiers to identify putative spectral markers and predict metastatic phenotype of tumors based on their optical spectra. We also used tumors derived from 4T1 cells silenced for the expression of TWIST, FOXC2 and CXCR3 genes to assess their Results: The MCR-ALS spectral decomposition showed consistent differences in the contribution of components that resembled collagen and lipids between the non-metastatic 67NR tumors and the metastatic tumors formed by FARN, 4T07, and 4T1 cells. Our Raman spectra-based random forest analysis provided evidence that machine learning models built on spectral data can allow the accurate identification of metastatic phenotype of independent test tumors. By silencing genes critical for metastasis in highly metastatic cell lines, we showed that the random forest classifiers provided predictions consistent with the observed phenotypic switch of the resultant tumors towards lower metastatic potential.

Poverty and systemic inequities are basic causes of undernutrition that also drive households to engage in circular migration for livelihood. Short-term, temporary move-ment of the whole family, including young children, is common; yet, the nutritional im-plications of recurrent movements beginning in early life has not been studied. We sought to estimate the association of repeat and early life migration with stunting and wasting outcomes among circular migrant children under three. Methods Using a stratified cluster design, we conducted two waves of primary data col-lection among 2564 randomly selected circular migrant children under three years of age temporarily residing across 1156 brick kilns in Bihar, India. We conducted multilev-el modeling to estimate the association of the number of migration episodes and age at first migration with stunting (<-2 standard deviations (SD) height-for-age z scores (HAZ)) and wasting (<-2 SD weight-for-height z-scores (WHZ)) and examined the determinants of nutrition status among migrant children, including diet, illness, food security and the health environment. Results The overall prevalence of stunting was 51.6%. Among children who were either born during migration or first migrated before six months of age, those who experienced multiple episodes of migration were more likely to be stunted compared to those who mi-grated once (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2.10; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.30-3.41). Children were over three times as likely to be wasted in the summer compared to the win-ter (aOR = 3.28; 95% CI = 2.68-4.01); in the summer, the overall prevalence of wasting was 38.8%. Public health access indicators such as interaction with frontline health workers at the destination was low (5.3%), whereas feeding indicators such as exclusive breastfeed-ing among 0-5 months was high (81.1%).

This AI-driven study is focused on segmentation, morphology, and distribution patterns of GGOs. MethodWe use an AI-driven unsupervised machine learning approach called PointNet++ to detect and quantify GGOs in CT scans of COVID-19 patients and to assess the severity of the disease. We have conducted our study on the MosMedData, which contains CT lung scans of 1110 patients with or without COVID-19 infections. We quantify the morphologies of GGOs using Minkowski tensors and compute the abnormality score of individual regions of segmented lung and GGOs. ResultsPointNet++ detects GGOs with the highest evaluation accuracy (98%), average class accuracy (95%), and intersection over union (92%) using only a fraction of 3D data. On average, the shapes of GGOs in the COVID-19 datasets deviate from sphericity by 15% and anisotropies in GGOs are dominated by dipole and hexapole components. These anisotropies may help to quantitatively delineate GGOs of COVID-19 from other lung diseases. ConclusionThe PointNet++ and the Minkowski tensor based morphological approach together with abnormality analysis will provide radiologists and clinicians with a valuable set of tools when interpreting CT lung scans of COVID-19 patients. Implementation would be particularly useful in countries severely devastated by COVID-19 such as India, where the number of cases has outstripped available resources creating delays or even breakdowns in patient care.

The CNS is separated and protected by a unique system of brain and blood vessel cells which together prevent most bloodborne therapeutics from entering the brain tumor microenvironment (TME). Recently, great strides have been made through microbubble (MB) ultrasound contrast agents in conjunction with ultrasound energy to locally increase the permeability of brain vessels and modulate the brain TME. As we elaborate in this review, this physical method can effectively deliver a wide range of anticancer agents, including chemotherapeutics, antibodies, and nanoparticle drug conjugates across a range of preclinical brain tumors, including high grade glioma (glioblastoma), diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas, and brain metastasis. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that this technology can promote the effective delivery of novel immunotherapeutic agents, including immune check-point inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor T cells, among others. With early clinical studies demonstrating safety, and several Phase I/II trials testing the preclinical findings underway, this technology is making firm steps towards shaping the future treatments of primary and metastatic brain cancer. By elaborating on its key components, including ultrasound systems and MB technology, along with methods for closed-loop spatial and temporal control of MB activity, we highlight how this technology can be tuned to enable new, personalized treatment strategies for primary brain malignancies and brain metastases.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

We analysed features associated with poor outcome (moderate to severe disability or death, 3 to 6 on the modified Rankin Scale) using multivariable models. Results We included 83 studies (31 unpublished) providing IPD for 1979 patients with COVID-19 and acute new-onset neurological disease. Encephalopathy (978 [49%] patients) and cerebrovascular events (506 [26%]) were the most common diagnoses. Respiratory and systemic symptoms preceded neurological features in 93% of patients; one third developed neurological disease after hospital admission. A poor outcome was more common in patients with cerebrovascular events (76% [95% CI 67-82]), than encephalopathy (54% [42-65]). Intensive care use was high (38% [35-41]) overall, and also greater in the cerebrovascular patients. In the cerebrovascular, but not encephalopathic patients, risk factors for poor outcome included breathlessness on admission and elevated D-dimer. Overall, 30-day mortality was 30% [27-32]. The hazard of death was comparatively lower for patients in the WHO European region. Interpretation Neurological COVID-19 disease poses a considerable burden in terms of disease outcomes and use of hospital resources from prolonged intensive care and inpatient admission; preliminary data suggest these may differ according to WHO regions and country income levels. The different risk factors for encephalopathy and stroke suggest different disease mechanisms which may be amenable to intervention, especially in those who develop neurological symptoms after hospital admission.",,2022,17,6,,,e0263595,10.1371/journal.pone.0263595,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263595,,35653330,WOS:000843619700020,View Full Record in Web of Science

Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists can invigorate antitumor T cell responses when administered directly to patients, but these responses often coincide with toxicities. We posited that TLR agonists could be repurposed ex vivo to condition T cells with remarkable potency in vivo, circumventing TLR-related toxicity. Methods In this study we investigated how tumor-specific murine CD8(+) T cells and human tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are impacted when expanded ex vivo with the TLR9 agonist CpG. Results Herein we reveal a new way to reverse the tolerant state of adoptively transferred CD8(+) T cells against tumors using TLR-activated B cells. We repurposed the TLR9 agonist, CpG, commonly used in the clinic, to bolster T cell-B cell interactions during expansion for ACT. T cells expanded ex vivo from a CpG-treated culture demonstrated potent antitumor efficacy and prolonged persistence in vivo. This antitumor efficacy was accomplished without in vivo administration of TLR agonists or other adjuvants of high-dose interleukin (IL)-2 or vaccination, which are classically required for effective ACT therapy. CpG-conditioned CD8(+) T cells acquired a unique proteomic signature hallmarked by an IL-2R alpha(high)ICOS(high)CD39(low) phenotype and an altered metabolic profile, all reliant on B cells transiently present in the culture. Likewise, human TILs benefitted from expansion with CpG ex vivo, as they also possessed the IL-2R alpha(high)ICOS(high)CD39(low) phenotype. CpG fostered the expansion of potent CD8(+) T cells with the signature phenotype and antitumor ability via empowering a direct B-T cell interaction. Isolated B cells also imparted T cells with the CpG-associated phenotype and improved tumor immunity without the aid of additional antigen-presenting cells or other immune cells in the culture. Conclusions Our results demonstrate a novel way to use TLR agonists to improve immunotherapy and reveal a vital role for B cells in the generation of potent CD8(+) T cell-based therapies.

Although multiple national organizations have created consensus guidelines and metrics for pediatric palliative care (PPC), standardized implementation and measurement has been challenging. In 2016, 6 PPC physician-experts in program development and quality improvement (QI) formed a healthcare learning collaborative network entitled the Pediatric Palliative Improvement Network (PPIN). Methods. The primary drivers identified were 1) Feasibility of a national learning network demonstrated through the completion of one small QI project, 2) Standard education in QI methodology and 3) Salient pediatric palliative care operational, clinical and satisfaction metrics clearly defined. Results. PPIN now includes146 members representing 51 organizations. In 2019 the group completed a national collaborative QI project focused on pain assessment at the time of initial consult, demonstrating a national increase in pain assessment from 75.8% to >90% over 12 months. PPIN has hosted two national QI workshops training more than 50 PPC clinicians in QI, with a 2-hour webinar provided in 2020 due to COVID. Monthly calls since 2017 provide QI methods refreshers, share local works in progress, and provide infrastructure for future collaborative projects. Conclusions. PPIN has become a sustainable organization which improves the quality of PPC through focus on national QI methods training, successful collaborative projects, and the creation of a learning and peer support community with regular calls. With the advent of the Palliative Care Quality Collaborative in 2020, PPIN provides critical educational and organizational infrastructure to inform ongoing quality efforts in PPC, now and in the future.

We conducted a national scale panel study using social-psychological data collected from 5,983 questionnaires to investigate the interactions between anxiety level, risk perception and coping behavior during different stages of COVID-19 in China. We found that sustained perceiving worries of being infected, first due to domestic and then global pandemic, contributed to the persistent high proportion of respondents with anxiety disorders which even gradually increased over time (56.1% during initiation to 60.4% during early vaccination). Gender was the strongest predictor of anxiety at all stages, with females having less confidence in COVID-19 control and always suffering from much higher anxiety levels than males even during the post peak stage. Excessive protective behavior and frequency of access to COVID-related news also contributed to public anxiety. Additionally, public risk perception was significantly associated with their willingness to vaccinate.

TXNDC5 was increased in human and mouse atherosclerotic lesions and induced in endothelium subjected to DF. Endothelium-specific Txndc5 deletion markedly reduced atherosclerosis in ApoE(-/-) mice. Mechanistically, DF-induced TXNDC5 increases proteasome-mediated degradation of heat shock factor 1, leading to reduced heat shock protein 90 and accelerated eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase) protein degradation.

Global psychometric assessment of cross-country, cross-time invariance of items measuring intimate partner violence (IPV) is needed to confirm their utility for comparing and monitoring national trends. Methods Analyses of seven physical-IPV items included 377,500 ever-partnered women across 20 countries (44 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS)). Analyses of five controlling-behaviors items included 371,846 women across 19 countries (42 DHS). We performed multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA) to assess within-country, cross-time invariance of each item set. Pooled analyses tested cross-country, cross-time invariance using DHSs that showed configural invariance in country-level multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFAs). Alignment optimization tested approximate invariance of each item set in the pooled sample of all datasets, and in the subset of countries showing metric invariance over at least two repeated cross-sectional surveys in country-level MGCFAs. Results In country-level MGCFAs, physical-IPV items and controlling-behaviors items functioned equivalently in repeated survey administrations in 12 and 11 countries, respectively. In MGCFA testing cross-country, cross-time invariance in pooled samples, neither item set was strictly equivalent; however, the physical-IPV items were approximately invariant. Controlling-behaviors items did not show approximate cross-country and cross-time invariance in the full sample or the sub-sample showing country-level metric invariance. Conclusion Physical-IPV items approached approximate invariance across 20 countries and were approximately invariant in 11 countries with repeated cross-sectional surveys.

Methods This phase I/II study enrolled patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) or advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The primary objectives of phase I were to investigate the safety and tolerability of isatuximab (anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody)+cemiplimab (anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, Isa+Cemi) in patients with mCRPC (naive to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy) or NSCLC (progressed on anti-PD-1/PD-L1-containing therapy). Phase II used Simon's two-stage design with response rate as the primary endpoint. An interim analysis was planned after the first 24 (mCRPC) and 20 (NSCLC) patients receiving Isa+Cemi were enrolled in phase II. Safety, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity were assessed, including CD38, PD-L1, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in the tumor microenvironment (TME), and peripheral immune cell phenotyping. Results Isa+Cemi demonstrated a manageable safety profile with no new safety signals. All patients experienced >= 1 treatment-emergent adverse event. Grade >= 3 events occurred in 13 (54.2%) patients with mCRPC and 12 (60.0%) patients with NSCLC. Based on PCWG3 criteria, assessment of best overall response with Isa+Cemi in mCRPC revealed no complete responses (CRs), one (4.2%) unconfirmed partial response (PR), and five (20.8%) patients with stable disease (SD). Per RECIST V.1.1, patients with NSCLC receiving Isa+Cemi achieved no CR or PR, and 13 (65%) achieved SD. In post-therapy biopsies obtained from patients with mCRPC or NSCLC, Isa+Cemi treatment resulted in a reduction in median CD38+ tumor-infiltrating immune cells from 40% to 3%, with no consistent modulation of PD-L1 on tumor cells or T regulatory cells in the TME. The combination triggered a significant increase in peripheral activated and cytolytic T cells but, interestingly, decreased natural killer cells. Conclusions The present study suggests that CD38 and PD-1 modulation by Isa+Cemi has a manageable safety profile, reduces CD38+ immune cells in the TME, and activates peripheral T cells; however, such CD38 inhibition was not associated with significant antitumor activity.

Disorders in gait, balance, and skilled movements are commonly assigned to chemotoxic damage of peripheral sensory neurons without consideration of the deterministic role played by the neural circuits that translate sensory information into movement. This oversight precludes sufficient, mechanistic understanding and contributes to the absence of effective treatment for reversing chemotherapy-induced disability. We rectified this omission through the use of a combination of electrophysiology, behavior, and modeling to study the operation of a spinal sensorimotor circuit in vivo in a rat model of chronic, oxaliplatin (chemotherapy)-induced neuropathy (cOIN). Key sequential events were studied in the encoding of propriosensory information and its circuit translation into the synaptic potentials produced in motoneurons. In cOIN rats, multiple classes of propriosensory neurons expressed defective firing that reduced accurate sensory representation of muscle mechanical responses to stretch. Accuracy degraded further in the translation of propriosensory signals into synaptic potentials as a result of defective mechanisms residing inside the spinal cord. These sequential, peripheral, and central defects compounded to drive the sensorimotor circuit into a functional collapse that was consequential in predicting the significant errors in propriosensory-guided movement behaviors demonstrated here in our rat model and reported for people with cOIN. We conclude that sensorimotor disability induced by cancer treatment emerges from the joint expression of independent defects occurring in both peripheral and central elements of sensorimotor circuits.",DEC 21,2021,118,51,,,e2100428118,10.1073/pnas.2100428118,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2100428118,,34911753,WOS:000736417600007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our laboratory previously reported physiological studies performed using a mouse gene trap model, which suffered from three limitations: perinatal lethality in homozygotes, constitutive Poldip2 inactivation and inadvertent downregulation of the adjacent Tmem199 gene. To overcome these limitations, we developed a new conditional floxed Poldip2 model. The first part of the present study shows that our initial floxed mice were affected by an unexpected mutation, which was not readily detected by Southern blotting and traditional PCR. It consisted of a 305 kb duplication around Poldip2 with retention of the wild type allele and could be traced back to the original targeted ES cell clone. We offer simple suggestions to rapidly detect similar accidents, which may affect genome editing using both traditional and CRISPR-based methods. In the second part of the present study, correctly targeted floxed Poldip2 mice were generated and used to produce a new constitutive knockout line by crossing with a Cre deleter. In contrast to the gene trap model, many homozygous knockout mice were viable, in spite of having no POLDIP2 expression.

Identifying host-specific genetic factors may reveal biological mechanisms of therapeutic relevance and clarify causal relationships of modifiable environmental risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and outcomes. We formed a global network of researchers to investigate the role of human genetics in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity. Here we describe the results of three genome-wide association meta-analyses that consist of up to 49,562 patients with COVID-19 from 46 studies across 19 countries. We report 13 genome-wide significant loci that are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe manifestations of COVID-19. Several of these loci correspond to previously documented associations to lung or autoimmune and inflammatory diseases(3-7). They also represent potentially actionable mechanisms in response to infection. Mendelian randomization analyses support a causal role for smoking and body-mass index for severe COVID-19 although not for type II diabetes. The identification of novel host genetic factors associated with COVID-19 was made possible by the community of human genetics researchers coming together to prioritize the sharing of data, results, resources and analytical frameworks. This working model of international collaboration underscores what is possible for future genetic discoveries in emerging pandemics, or indeed for any complex human disease.",DEC 16,2021,600,7889,472,+,,10.1038/s41586-021-03767-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03767-x,,34237774,WOS:000815169400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Previous reports of male overrepresentation in books targeted towards children are consistent with a history of gender disparity across media and society. However, it is unknown whether such bias has been attenuated in recent years with increasing emphasis on gender equity and greater accessibility of books. Here, we provide an up-to-date estimate of the relative proportion of males and females featured as single protagonists in 3,280 children's books (0-16 years) published between 1960-2020. We find that although the proportion of female protagonists has increased over this 60-year period, male protagonists remain overrepresented even in recent years. Importantly, we also find persistent effects related to author gender, age of the target audience, character type (human vs. non-human), and book genre (fiction vs. non-fiction) on the male-to-female ratio of protagonists. We suggest that this comprehensive account of the factors influencing the rates of appearance of male and female protagonists can be leveraged to develop specific recommendations for promoting more equitable gender representation in children's literature, with important consequences for child development and society.",DEC 15,2021,16,12,,,e0260566,10.1371/journal.pone.0260566,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0260566,,34910745,WOS:000754828900019,View Full Record in Web of Science

Background Oral chemotherapy adherence is critical to determine the treatment efficacy among cancer patients. Identifying predictors before discharge from hospital based on transition theory could assist healthcare providers to improve oral chemotherapy adherence at home. Design An observational prospective study. Methods Between October 2018 and December 2019, self-reported questionnaires were used to collect data among 151 cancer patients with oral chemotherapy at home. At discharge, baseline data of patient-perceived readiness for hospital discharge, financial toxicity and non-adherence experience were collected, while symptoms and adherence of oral chemotherapy at home were collected after finishing one cycle of oral chemotherapy at home (21 days, the first 14 days received oral chemotherapy). Regression analyses were performed for the predictors' explorations. The STROBE guidelines were followed. Results Among 151 participants with oral chemotherapy at home, 30.46% of patients reported medication non-adherence experience at discharge and 82.12% of patients reported adherence to oral chemotherapy at home. Patients with non-adherence experience at discharge were 5.4 times more likely to being non-adhered to oral chemotherapy at home. Numbness were the most frequent and severe symptoms during at home, patients with numbness were 6.6 times more likely to being non-adhered to oral chemotherapy. Although patients reported high level of readiness for discharge and financial toxicity at discharge, which did not predicted oral chemotherapy adherence at home. Conclusions Patients with medication non-adherence experience at discharge and symptom of numbness from oral chemotherapy suggested a higher risk of oral chemotherapy non-adherence at home. Relevance to clinical practice Preventive interventions should focus on patients with previous medication non-adherence experience at discharge and experiencing numbness to promote oral chemotherapy adherence.",,,,,,,,10.1111/jocn.16170,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jocn.16170,DEC 2021,34913534,WOS:000730480400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The somatically diversified repertoires of these VLRs are generated by serial step-wise copying of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) sequences into an incomplete germline VLR gene. Lymphocytes that express VLRA or VLRC are T cell-like, while VLRB-expressing cells are B cell-like. Here, we analyze the composition of the VLRB locus in different jawless vertebrates to elucidate its configuration and evolutionary modification. The incomplete germline VLRB genes of two hagfish species contain short noncoding intervening sequences, whereas germline VLRB genes in six representative lamprey species have much longer intervening sequences that exhibit notable genomic variation. Genomic clusters of potential LRR cassette donors, fragments of which are copied to complete VLRB gene assembly, are identified in Japanese lamprey and sea lamprey. In the sea lamprey, 428 LRR cassettes are located in five clusters spread over a total of 1.7 Mbp of chromosomal DNA. Preferential usage of the different donor cassettes for VLRB assemblage is characterized in our analysis, which reveals evolutionary modifications of the lamprey VLRB genes, elucidates the organization of the complex VLRB locus, and provides a comprehensive catalog of donor VLRB cassettes in sea lamprey and Japanese lamprey.",DEC 14,2021,118,50,,,e2116522118,10.1073/pnas.2116522118,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2116522118,,34880135,WOS:000732715700056,View Full Record in Web of Science

Gene therapy with the use of LentiGlobin for sickle cell disease (bb1111; lovotibeglogene autotemcel) consists of autologous transplantation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells transduced with the BB305 lentiviral vector encoding a modified beta-globin gene, which produces an antisickling hemoglobin, HbA(T87Q). METHODS In this ongoing phase 1-2 study, we optimized the treatment process in the initial 7 patients in Group A and 2 patients in Group B with sickle cell disease. Group C was established for the pivotal evaluation of LentiGlobin for sickle cell disease, and we adopted a more stringent inclusion criterion that required a minimum of four severe vaso-occlusive events in the 24 months before enrollment. In this unprespecified interim analysis, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of LentiGlobin in 35 patients enrolled in Group C. Included in this analysis was the number of severe vaso-occlusive events after LentiGlobin infusion among patients with at least four vaso-occlusive events in the 24 months before enrollment and with at least 6 months of follow-up. RESULTS As of February 2021, cell collection had been initiated in 43 patients in Group C; 35 received a LentiGlobin infusion, with a median follow-up of 17.3 months (range, 3.7 to 37.6). Engraftment occurred in all 35 patients. The median total hemoglobin level increased from 8.5 g per deciliter at baseline to 11 g or more per deciliter from 6 months through 36 months after infusion. HbA(T87Q) contributed at least 40% of total hemoglobin and was distributed across a mean (+/- SD) of 85 +/- 8% of red cells. Hemolysis markers were reduced. Among the 25 patients who could be evaluated, all had resolution of severe vaso-occlusive events, as compared with a median of 3.5 events per year (range, 2.0 to 13.5) in the 24 months before enrollment. Three patients had a nonserious adverse event related or possibly related to LentiGlobin that resolved within 1 week after onset. No cases of hematologic cancer were observed during up to 37.6 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS One-time treatment with LentiGlobin resulted in sustained production of HbA(T87Q) in most red cells, leading to reduced hemolysis and complete resolution of severe vaso-occlusive events.",FEB 17,2022,386,7,617,628,,10.1056/NEJMoa2117175,http://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2117175,DEC 2021,34898139,WOS:000729272600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite advances in prevention and treatment, in particular through reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels(2), heart disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide(3). Genome-wideassociation studies (GWAS) of blood lipid levels have led to important biological and clinical insights, as well as new drug targets, for cardiovascular disease. However, most previous GWAS(4-23) have been conducted in European ancestry populations and may have missed genetic variants that contribute to lipid-level variation in other ancestry groups. These include differences in allele frequencies, effect sizes and linkage-disequilibrium patterns(24). Here we conduct a multi-ancestry, genome-wide genetic discovery meta-analysis of lipid levels in approximately 1.65 million individuals, including 350,000 of non-European ancestries. We quantify the gain in studying non-European ancestries and provide evidence to support the expansion of recruitment of additional ancestries, even with relatively small sample sizes. We find that increasing diversity rather than studying additional individuals of European ancestry results in substantial improvements in fine-mapping functional variants and portability of polygenic prediction (evaluated in approximately 295,000 individuals from 7 ancestry groupings). Modest gains in the number of discovered loci and ancestry-specific variants were also achieved. As GWAS expand emphasis beyond the identification of genes and fundamental biology towards the use of genetic variants for preventive and precision medicine(25), we anticipate that increased diversity of participants will lead to more accurate and equitable(26) application of polygenic scores in clinical practice.",DEC 23,2021,600,7890,675,+,,10.1038/s41586-021-04064-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-04064-3,DEC 2021,34887591,WOS:000728504500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Several COVID-19 vaccines have received emergency use authorisations from the US Food and Drug Administration, with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine receiving full approval on Aug 23, 2021. When paired with masking, physical distancing, and ventilation, COVID-19 vaccines are the best intervention to sustainably control the pandemic. However, surveys have consistently found that a sizeable minority of US residents do not plan to get a COVID-19 vaccine. The most severe consequence of an inadequate uptake of COVID-19 vaccines has been sustained community transmission (including of the delta [B.1.617.2] variant, a surge of which began in July, 2021). Exacerbating the direct impact of the virus, a low uptake of COVID-19 vaccines will prolong the social and economic repercussions of the pandemic on families and communities, especially low-income and minority ethnic groups, into 2022, or even longer. The scale and challenges of the COVI D-19 vaccination campaign are unprecedented.

The primary endpoints were the maximum tolerated dose, recommended phase 2 dose and safety of avapritinib. Secondary endpoints included overall response rate and changes in measures of mast cell burden. Avapritinib was evaluated at doses of 30-400 mg once daily in 86 patients, 69 with centrally confirmed AdvSM. Maximum tolerated dose was not reached, and 200 mg and 300 mg daily were studied in dose-expansion cohorts. The most frequent adverse events observed were periorbital edema (69%), anemia (55%), diarrhea (45%), thrombocytopenia (44%) and nausea (44%). Intracranial bleeding occurred in 13% overall, but in only 1% of patients without severe thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 x 10(9)/l).

The symptom burden associated with heart failure (HF) remains high despite improvements in therapy and calls for the integration of palliative care into traditional HF care. Little is also known about how patients with HF perceive palliative care and patient-level characteristics associated with the need for palliative care, which could influence the utilization of palliative care in HF management. Objectives. To identify characteristics of HF patients associated with perceived need for palliative care. Methods. We analyzed data from the Hopeful Heart Trial, which studied the efficacy of a collaborative care intervention for treating both systolic HF and depression. Palliative care preferences were collected during routine study follow-up. We assessed the association of perceived need for palliative care during study follow-up and baseline data on sociodemographics, clinical measures, and patient-centered outcomes. We then used descriptive statistics and logistic regression to analyze our data. Results. Participants were on average 64 years old, male, and reported severe HF symptoms and poor to below average quality of life (. Most had unfavorable impressions of palliative care, but many still perceived a need for palliative care. Factors associated with perceived need for palliative care included depression, non-white race, more severe HF symptoms, and lower mental & physical health-related quality of life. Conclusion. HF patients' beliefs about palliative care may affect utilization of palliative care. Specific characteristics can help identify patients with HF who may benefit from palliative care involvement. Education targeted towards patients with selected attributes may help incorporate palliative care into HF management. (C) 2021 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine.

However, nursing research courses are highly theoretical, which is difficult for students to understand. Improving the teaching quality of nursing research courses is a challenge for educators. Objectives: To understand the learning experience and the effect of gamification teaching on nursing undergraduates, and to provide new ideas for nurse educators. Design: A qualitative research design using individual semi-structured interviews. Settings: Gamification teaching was applied in an undergraduate nursing research course over one semester at a university in Central China. Participants: Purposive sampling was adopted to select nine undergraduate nursing students who had recently completed gamification teaching in a nursing research course. Methods: Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and analyzed using Colaizzi's phenomenological method. Results: Three major themes and seven subthemes emerged from the interviewees' experience: (1) positive attitude (e.g., acceptance with pleasure and flow experience); (2) self-perceived competence improvement (e.g., creative thinking, collaboration, and knowledge internalization and application); and (3) challenges of gamification teaching (e.g., learning pressure and rationality of game design).

METHODS This observational study captured clinical and sociodemographic characteristics for children (<= 21 years) receiving cancer therapy and infected with SARS-CoV-2 from the pandemic onset through February 19, 2021. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the cohort were compared with population-level pediatric oncology data (SEER). Multivariable binomial regression models evaluated patient characteristics associated with hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and changes in cancer therapy. RESULTS Ninety-four institutions contributed details on 917 children with cancer and SARS-CoV-2. Median age at SARS-CoV-2 infection was 11 years (range, 0-21 years). Compared with SEER, there was an over-representation of Hispanics (43.6% v 29.7%, P < .01), publicly insured (59.3% v 33.5%, P < .01), and patients with hematologic malignancies (65.8% v38.3%, P< .01) in our cohort. The majority (64.1%) were symptomatic; 31.2% were hospitalized, 10.9% required respiratory support, 9.2% were admitted to the ICU, and 1.6% died because of SARS-CoV-2. Cancer therapy was modified in 44.9%. Hispanic ethnicity was associated with changes in cancer-directed therapy (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.6]). Presence of comorbidities was associated with hospitalization (aRR = 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.6) and ICU admission (aRR = 2.3; 95% CI, 1.5 to 3.6). Hematologic malignancies were associated with hospitalization (aRR = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.3 to 2.1). CONCLUSION These findings provide critical information for decision making among pediatric oncologists, including inpatient versus outpatient management, cancer therapy modifications, consideration of monoclonal antibody therapy, and counseling families on infection risks in the setting of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The over-representation of Hispanic and publicly insured patients in this national cohort suggests disparities that require attention.

In women with positive lymph-node disease, the role of the recurrence score with respect to predicting a benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy is unclear. METHODS In a prospective trial, we randomly assigned women with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, one to three positive axillary lymph nodes, and a recurrence score of 25 or lower (scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a worse prognosis) to endocrine therapy only or to chemotherapy plus endocrine (chemoendocrine) therapy. The primary objective was to determine the effect of chemotherapy on invasive disease-free survival and whether the effect was influenced by the recurrence score. Secondary end points included distant relapse-free survival. RESULTS A total of 5083 women (33.2% premenopausal and 66.8% postmenopausal) underwent randomization, and 5018 participated in the trial. At the prespecified third interim analysis, the chemotherapy benefit with respect to increasing invasive disease-free survival differed according to menopausal status (P = 0.008 for the comparison of chemotherapy benefit in premenopausal and postmenopausal participants), and separate prespecified analyses were conducted. Among postmenopausal women, invasive disease-free survival at 5 years was 91.9% in the endocrine-only group and 91.3% in the chemoendocrine group, with no chemotherapy benefit (hazard ratio for invasive disease recurrence, new primary cancer [breast cancer or another type], or death, 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 1.26; P = 0.89). Among premenopausal women, invasive disease-free survival at 5 years was 89.0% with endocrine-only therapy and 93.9% with chemoendocrine therapy (hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.83; P = 0.002), with a similar increase in distant relapse-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.87; P = 0.009). The relative chemotherapy benefit did not increase as the recurrence score increased. CONCLUSIONS Among premenopausal women with one to three positive lymph nodes and a recurrence score of 25 or lower, those who received chemoendocrine therapy had longer invasive disease-free survival and distant relapse-free survival than those who received endocrine-only therapy, whereas postmenopausal women with similar characteristics did not benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.",DEC 16,2021,385,25,2336,2347,,10.1056/NEJMoa2108873,http://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2108873,DEC 2021,34914339,WOS:000724451400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Thus, we need to understand how the budget of insurance is currently used. The objective of the present study is to overview the utilization of the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) by providing the direct insured cost between patients receiving surgery and patients receiving nonsurgical treatment for degenerative lumbar disease. Methods The NHIS-National Sample Cohort was utilized to select patients with lumbar disc herniation, spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis or spondylolysis. A matched cohort study design was used to show direct medical costs of surgery (n = 2,698) and nonsurgical (n = 2,698) cohorts. Non-surgical treatment included medication, physiotherapy, injection, and chiropractic. The monthly costs of the surgery cohort and nonsurgical cohort were presented at initial treatment, posttreatment 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months and yearly thereafter for 10 years. Results The characteristics and matching factors were well-balanced between the matched cohorts. Overall, surgery cohort spent $50.84/patient/month, while the nonsurgical cohort spent $29.34/patient/month (p<0.01). Initially, surgery treatment led to more charge to NHIS ($2,762) than nonsurgical treatment ($180.4) (p<0.01). Compared with the non-surgical cohort, the surgery cohort charged $33/month more for the first 3 months, charged less at 12 months, and charged approximately the same over the course of 10 years. Conclusion Surgical treatment initially led to more government reimbursement than nonsurgical treatment, but the charges during follow-up period were not different. The results of the present study should be interpreted in light of the costs of medical services, indirect costs, societal cost, quality of life and societal willingness to pay in each country.

Despite the generally accepted premise that traditional hands-on laboratory experiences are essential to knowledge construction and superior to non-traditional online experiences, the literature suggests that both experiences promote equal levels of student learning. Objectives: We compared academic performance of students enrolled in a Human Anatomy and Physiology II course with hands-on laboratory to that of students enrolled in the same course but with online laboratory by examining several measures of student learning. Design and participants: This was a quasi-experimental study of undergraduate students aged 18-22 years enrolled in equivalent human anatomy and physiology courses on two separate campuses of a private research university in the United States. One course was associated with hands-on laboratory while the other course was associated with online laboratory. Methods: The Human Anatomy and Physiology Society standardized exam was administered as a pre-test/posttest assessment at the beginning and end of the academic year. Lecture exam scores, laboratory exam scores, and overall course grades served as measures of student learning. Comparisons of student performance between hands-on and online laboratory groups were made using t-tests. Results: Student performance on the pre-test and overall course grades from Human Anatomy and Physiology (part I) were not different between groups. While students in the online lab group did earn significantly higher Human Anatomy and Physiology (part II) course grades, their performance on lecture exams, laboratory exams, and the post-test assessment was not different.

Aluminum hydroxide (alum) adjuvant is the most widely available vaccine adjuvant but elicits modest humoral responses. We hypothesized that phosphate-mediated coanchoring of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 together with molecular adjuvants on alum particles could potentiate humoral immunity by promoting extended vaccine kinetics and codelivery of vaccine components to lymph nodes. Modification of RBD immunogens with phosphoserine (pSer) peptides enabled efficient alum binding and slowed antigen clearance, leading to notable increases in germinal center responses and neutralizing antibody titers in mice. Adding phosphate-containing CpG or saponin adjuvants to pSer-RBD:alum immunizations synergistically enhanced vaccine immunogenicity in mice and rhesus macaques, inducing neutralizing responses against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Thus, phosphate-mediated coanchoring of RBD and molecular adjuvants to alum is an effective strategy to enhance the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines.",DEC,2021,7,50,,,eabj6538,10.1126/sciadv.abj6538,http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abj6538,,34878851,WOS:000728174000013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Genomic profiling of de novo and relapsed or refractory childhood cancer has led to increased identification of new drug targets in the last decade. The aim of this study is to examine the SPU experience for genomically targeted therapies in patients with pediatric cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS All genomically targeted therapeutic SPUs obtained over a 5-year period were evaluated at four large pediatric cancer programs. Data were collected on the type of neoplasm, agents requested, corresponding molecularly informed targets, and clinical outcomes. RESULTS A total of 45 SPUs in 44 patients were identified. Requests were predominantly made for CNS and solid tumors (84.4%) compared with hematologic malignancies (15.6%). Lack of an available clinical trial was the main reason for SPU initiation (64.4%). The median time from US Food and Drug Administration submission to approval was 3 days (range, 0-12 days) and from Institutional Review Board submission to approval was 5 days (range, 0-50 days). Objective tumor response was seen in 39.5% (15 of 38) of all evaluable SPUs. Disease progression was the primary reason for discontinuation of drug (66.7%) followed by toxicity (13.3%). CONCLUSION SPU requests remain an important mechanism for pediatric access to genomically targeted agents given the limited availability of targeted clinical trials for children with high-risk neoplasms. Furthermore, this subset of SPUs resulted in a substantial number of objective tumor responses. The development of a multi-institutional data registry of SPUs may enable systematic review of toxicity and clinical outcomes and provide evidence-based access to new drugs in rare pediatric cancers.",DEC 1,2021,39,34,3822,+,,10.1200/JCO.21.01213,http://dx.doi.org/10.1200/JCO.21.01213,,34591650,WOS:000778997500008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease with a lifetime risk of one in 350 people and an unmet need for disease-modifying therapies. We conducted a cross-ancestry genome-wide association study (GWAS) including 29,612 patients with ALS and 122,656 controls, which identified 15 risk loci. When combined with 8,953 individuals with whole-genome sequencing (6,538 patients, 2,415 controls) and a large cortex-derived expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) dataset (MetaBrain), analyses revealed locus-specific genetic architectures in which we prioritized genes either through rare variants, short tandem repeats or regulatory effects. ALS-associated risk loci were shared with multiple traits within the neurodegenerative spectrum but with distinct enrichment patterns across brain regions and cell types. Of the environmental and lifestyle risk factors obtained from the literature, Mendelian randomization analyses indicated a causal role for high cholesterol levels. The combination of all ALS-associated signals reveals a role for perturbations in vesicle-mediated transport and autophagy and provides evidence for cell-autonomous disease initiation in glutamatergic neurons.",DEC,2021,53,12,1636,+,,10.1038/s41588-021-00973-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41588-021-00973-1,,34873335,WOS:000727387900007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods An online national cross-sectional pilot-validated questionnaire was self-administered by HCWs in Saudi Arabia, which is a nation with MERS-CoV experience. The main outcome variable was HCWs' acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine candidates. The factors associated with vaccination acceptance were identified through a logistic regression analysis, and the level of anxiety was measured using a validated instrument to measure general anxiety levels. Results Out of the 1512 HCWs who completed the study questionnaire-of which 62.4% were women-70% were willing to receive COVID-19 vaccines. A logistic regression analysis revealed that male HCWs (ORa = 1.551, 95% CI: 1.122-2.144), HCWs who believe in vaccine safety (ORa = 2.151; 95% CI: 1.708-2.708), HCWs who believe that COVID vaccines are the most likely way to stop the pandemic (ORa = 1.539; 95% CI: 1.259-1.881), and HCWs who rely on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for COVID 19 updates (ORa = 1.505, 95% CI: 1.125-2.013) were significantly associated with reporting a willingness to be vaccinated. However, HCWs who believed that the vaccines were rushed without evidence-informed testing were found to be 60% less inclined to accept COVID-19 vaccines (ORa = 0.394, 95% CI: 0.298-0.522). Conclusion Most HCWs are willing to receive COVID-19 vaccines once they are available; the satisfactoriness of COVID-19 vaccination among HCWs is crucial because health professionals' knowledge and confidence toward vaccines are important determining factors for not only their own vaccine acceptance but also recommendation for such vaccines to their patients.",NOV 29,2021,16,11,,,e0244415,10.1371/journal.pone.0244415,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244415,,34843462,WOS:000752076100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We used hierarchal clustering and partial least squares-discriminant analysis to profile the tracheal aspirate airway fluid using quantitative LC-MS/MS to explore clusters of metabolites that correlated with acute hypoxemia severity and ventilator-free days. Three clusters of children that differed by severity of hypoxemia and ventilator-free days were identified. Quantitative pathway enrichment analysis showed that cysteine and methionine metabolism, selenocompound metabolism, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, arginine biosynthesis, and valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis were the top five enriched, impactful pathways.

This trial assessed the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib versus placebo in patients with polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Methods This double-blind, withdrawal phase 3 trial enrolled patients with polyarticular course JIA (extended oligoarthritis, rheumatoid factor-positive or rheumatoid factor-negative polyarthritis, or systemic JIA without active systemic features) aged 2 years to younger than 18 years, and was done at 64 centres of the Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation and Pediatric Rheumatology Collaborative Study Group networks in 14 countries. Patients with psoriatic arthritis or enthesitis-related arthritis were enrolled for exploratory endpoints. During part 1 of the study, patients received oral open-label tofacitinib (weight-based doses; 5 mg twice daily or lower) for 18 weeks. Patients achieving at least JIA/American College of Rheumatology 30 response were randomly assigned (1:1) using an Interactive Response Technology system to continue tofacitinib or switch to placebo in part 2 of the study for 26 weeks. The primary endpoint was JIA flare rate by week 44 in part 2 in patients with polyarticular course JIA; the intentionto-treat principle was applied. Safety was evaluated throughout part 1 and part 2 of the study in all patients who received one dose or snore of study medication. This trial is registered with ClinicalTriats.gov, NCT02592434. Findings Between June 10, 2016, and May 16, 2019, of 225 patients enrolled, 184 (82%) patients had polyarticular course JIA, 20 (9%) had psoriatic arthritis, and 21 (9%) had enthesitis-related arthritis. 147 (65%) of 225 patients received concomitant methotrexate. In part 2, 142 patients with polyarticular course JIA were assigned to tofacitinib (n=72) or placebo (n=70). Flare rate by week 44 was significantly lower with tofacitinib (21 [29%] of 72 patients) than with placebo (37 [53%] of 70 patients; hazard ratio 0.46, 95% CI 0.27-0.79; p=0.0031). In part 2 of the study, adverse events occurred in 68 (77%) of 88 patients receiving tofacitinib and 63 (74%) of 85 in the placebo group. Serious adverse events occurred in one (1%) and two (2%), respectively. In the entire tofacitinib exposure period, 107 (48%) of 225 patients had infections or infestations. There were no deaths during this study. Interpretation The results of this pivotal trial show that tofacitinib is an effective treatment in patients with polyarticular course JIA. New oral therapies are particularly relevant for children and adolescents, who might prefer to avoid injections. Copyright (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Family caregivers provide substantial care to persons living with PD, often at great personal cost. While spiritual well-being and spirituality have been suggested to promote resiliency in caregivers of persons living with cancer and dementia, this issue has not been explored in PD.Objective: The aim of this study was to identify predictors of spiritual well-being in PD patients' caregivers.Design: A cross-sectional analysis was performed. Our primary outcome measure, the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-Being (FACIT-Sp), was measured in caregivers alongside measures of patient quality of life, symptom burden, global function, grief, and spiritual well-being and caregiver mood, burden, and perceptions of patient quality of life. Univariate correlation and multiple regression were used to determine associations between predictor variables and caregiver FACIT-Sp.Setting/Subjects: PD patient/caregiver dyads were recruited through three academic medical centers in the United States and Canada and regional community support groups.Results: We recruited 183 dyads. Patient faith, symptom burden, health-related quality of life, depression, motor function, and grief were significant predictors of caregiver spiritual well-being. Predictive caregiver factors included caregiver depression and anxiety. These factors remained significant in combined models, suggesting that both patient and caregiver factors make independent contributions to caregiver spiritual well-being.Conclusions: The present study suggests that both patient and caregiver factors are associated with spiritual well-being in PD. Further study is needed to understand the causal relationship of these factors and whether interventions to support caregiver spiritual well-being improve outcomes for caregivers or patients.Clinicaltrials.gov registration NCT02533921.",APR,2022,25,4,606,613,,10.1089/jpm.2020.0797,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/jpm.2020.0797,NOV 2021,34818097,WOS:000722844400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Frameworks and models (FM) are valuable tools in conceptualizing and guiding the study of de-implementation. This scoping review sought to identify and characterize FM that can be used to study de-implementation as a phenomenon and identify gaps in the literature to inform future model development and application for research. Methods We searched nine databases and eleven journals from a broad array of disciplines (e.g., healthcare, public health, public policy) for de-implementation studies published between 1990 and June 2020. Two raters independently screened titles and abstracts, and then a pair of raters screened all full text records. We extracted information related to setting, discipline, study design, methodology, and FM characteristics from included studies. Results The final search yielded 1860 records, from which we screened 126 full text records. We extracted data from 27 articles containing 27 unique FM. Most FM (n = 21) were applicable to two or more levels of the Socio-Ecological Framework, and most commonly assessed constructs were at the organization level (n = 18). Most FM (n = 18) depicted a linear relationship between constructs, few depicted a more complex structure, such as a nested or cyclical relationship. Thirteen studies applied FM in empirical investigations of de-implementation, while 14 articles were commentary or review papers that included FM. Conclusion De-implementation is a process studied in a broad array of disciplines, yet implementation science has thus far been limited in the integration of learnings from other fields. This review offers an overview of visual representations of FM that implementation researchers and practitioners can use to inform their work. Additional work is needed to test and refine existing FM and to determine the extent to which FM developed in one setting or for a particular topic can be applied to other contexts. Given the extensive availability of FM in implementation science, we suggest researchers build from existing FM rather than recreating novel FM.

Like other neuron types, alpha motoneurons in the mammalian spinal cord express heterogeneity and plasticity in AIS geometry, including length (AIS(l)) and distance from soma (AIS(d)). The present study aimed to establish the relationship of AIS geometry with a measure of intrinsic excitability, rheobase current, that varies by 20-fold or more among normal motoneurons. We began by determining whether AIS length or distance differed for motoneurons in motor pools that exhibit different activity profiles. Motoneurons sampled from the medial gastrocnemius (MG) motor pool exhibited values for average AIS(d) that were significantly greater than that for motoneurons from the soleus (SOL) motor pool, which is more readily recruited in low-level activities. Next, we tested whether AIS(d) covaried with intrinsic excitability of individual motoneurons. In anesthetized rats, we measured rheobase current intracellularly from MG motoneurons in vivo before labeling them for immunohistochemical study of AIS structure. For 16 motoneurons sampled from the MG motor pool, this combinatory approach revealed that AIS(d), but not AIS(l), was significantly related to rheobase, as AIS tended to be located further from the soma on motoneurons that were less excitable. Although a causal relation with excitability seems unlikely, AIS(d) falls among a constellation of properties related to the recruitability of motor units and their parent motoneurons.",NOV 19,2021,16,11,,,e0259918,10.1371/journal.pone.0259918,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0259918,,34797870,WOS:000755334700024,View Full Record in Web of Science

Plasma biomarker concentrations (cotinine, nicotine) assessed passive smoke exposure. Neonatal anthropometric measures included weight, 8 non-skeletal, and 2 skeletal measures. Linear regression evaluated associations between continuous biomarker concentrations and neonatal anthropometric measures by race/ethnicity. Cotinine concentrations were low and the percent above limit of quantification varied by maternal race/ethnicity (10% Whites; 14% Asians; 15% Hispanics; 49% Blacks). The association between cotinine concentration and infant weight differed by race/ethnicity (P-interaction = 0.034); compared to women of the same race/ethnicity, per 1 log-unit increase in cotinine, weight increased 48g (95%CI -44, 139) in White and 51g (95%CI -81, 183) in Hispanic women, but decreased -90g (95%CI -490, 309) in Asian and -93g (95%CI -151, -35) in Black women.

Typical approaches to identify T-cell epitopes utilising extensive peptide sets require subjects' cell numbers that exceed feasible sample volumes. To address this, CD8 T-cells were polyclonally expanded from PBMC from 13 anti-retroviral naive subjects living with HIV using CD3/CD4 bi-specific antibody. Assessment of recognition of individual peptides within a set of 1408 HIV-1 Gag, Nef, Pol and Env potential T-cell epitope peptides was achieved by sequential IFN. ELISpot assays using peptides pooled in 3-D matrices followed by confirmation with single peptides. A Renilla reniformis luciferase viral inhibition assay assessed CD8 T-cell-mediated inhibition of replication of a cross-clade panel of 10 HIV-1 isolates, including 9 transmitted-founder isolates. Polyclonal expansion from one frozen PBMC vial provided sufficient CD8 T-cells for both ELISpot steps in 12 of 13 subjects. A median of 33 peptides in 16 epitope regions were recognised including peptides located in previously characterised HIV-1 epitope-rich regions. There was no significant difference between ELISpot magnitudes for in vitro expanded CD8 T-cells and CD8 T-cells directly isolated from PBMCs. CD8 T-cells from all subjects inhibited a median of 7 HIV-1 isolates (range 4 to 10). The breadth of CD8 T-cell mediated HIV-1 inhibition was significantly positively correlated with CD8 T-cell breadth of peptide recognition. Polyclonal CD8 T-cell expansion allowed identification of HIV-1 isolates inhibited and peptides recognised within a large peptide set spanning the major HIV-1 proteins. This approach overcomes limitations associated with obtaining sufficient cell numbers to fully characterise HIV-1-specific CD8 T-cell responses by different functional read-outs within the context of extreme HIV-1 diversity.

Multiple methods have been proposed for AFib detection, with varying performances, but no single approach appears to be optimal. We hypothesized that each state-of-the-art algorithm is appropriate for different subsets of patients and provides some independent information. Therefore, a set of suitably chosen algorithms, combined in a weighted voting framework, will provide a superior performance to any single algorithm. Methods We investigate and modify 38 state-of-the-art AFib classification algorithms for a single-lead ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring device. All algorithms are ranked using a random forest classifier and an expert-labeled training dataset of 2,532 recordings. The seven top-ranked algorithms are combined by using an optimized weighting approach. Results The proposed fusion algorithm, when validated on a separate test dataset consisting of 4,644 recordings, resulted in an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.99. The sensitivity, specificity, positive-predictive-value (PPV), negative-predictive-value (NPV), and F1-score of the proposed algorithm were 0.93, 0.97, 0.87, 0.99, and 0.90, respectively, which were all superior to any single algorithm or any previously published. Conclusion This study demonstrates how a set of well-chosen independent algorithms and a voting mechanism to fuse the outputs of the algorithms, outperforms any single state-of-the-art algorithm for AFib detection. The proposed framework is a case study for the general notion of crowdsourcing between open-source algorithms in healthcare applications. The extension of this framework to similar applications may significantly save time, effort, and resources, by combining readily existing algorithms.

Echocardiographic screening detects rheumatic heart disease at an early, latent stage. Whether secondary antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in preventing progression of latent rheumatic heart disease is unknown. METHODS We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of secondary antibiotic prophylaxis in Ugandan children and adolescents 5 to 17 years of age with latent rheumatic heart disease. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either injections of penicillin G benzathine (also known as benzathine benzylpenicillin) every 4 weeks for 2 years or no prophylaxis. All the participants underwent echocardiography at baseline and at 2 years after randomization. Changes from baseline were adjudicated by a panel whose members were unaware of the trial-group assignments. The primary outcome was echocardiographic progression of latent rheumatic heart disease at 2 years. RESULTS Among 102,200 children and adolescents who had screening echocardiograms, 3327 were initially assessed as having latent rheumatic heart disease, and 926 of the 3327 subsequently received a definitive diagnosis on the basis of confirmatory echocardiography and were determined to be eligible for the trial. Consent or assent for participation was provided for 916 persons, and all underwent randomization; 818 participants were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis, and 799 (97.7%) completed the trial. A total of 3 participants (0.8%) in the prophylaxis group had echocardiographic progression at 2 years, as compared with 33 (8.2%) in the control group (risk difference, -7.5 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -10.2 to -4.7; P<0.001). Two participants in the prophylaxis group had serious adverse events that were attributable to receipt of prophylaxis, including one episode of a mild anaphylactic reaction (representing <0.1% of all administered doses of prophylaxis).

Venetoclax efficacy in RRMM may be potentiated through combination with agents including bortezomib, dexamethasone, and daratumumab. METHODS This phase I study (NCT03314181) evaluated venetoclax with daratumumab and dexamethasone (VenDd) in patients with t(11;14) RRMM and VenDd with bortezomib (VenDVd) in cytogenetically unselected patients with RRMM. Primary objectives included expansion-phase dosing, safety, and overall response rate. Secondary objectives included further safety analysis, progression-free survival, duration of response, time to progression, and minimal residual disease negativity. RESULTS Forty-eight patients were enrolled, 24 each in parts 1 (VenDd) and 2 (VenDVd). There was one dose-limiting toxicity in part 1 (grade 3 febrile neutropenia, 800 mg VenDd). Common adverse events with VenDd and VenDVd included diarrhea (63% and 54%) and nausea (50% and 50%); grade >= 3 adverse events were observed in 88% in the VenDd group and 71% in the VenDVd group. One treatment-emergent death occurred in part 2 (sepsis) in the context of progressive disease, with no other infection-related deaths on study with medians of 20.9 and 20.4 months of follow-up in parts 1 and 2, respectively. The overall response rate was 96% with VenDd (all very good partial response or better [>= VGPR]) and 92% with VenDVd (79% >= VGPR).

This phase III study investigated the efficacy and safety of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor veliparib in combination with conventional chemotherapy for advanced sqNSCLC (NCT02106546). PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients age >= 18 years with untreated, advanced sqNSCLC were randomly assigned 1:1 to carboplatin and paclitaxel with veliparib 120 mg twice daily (twice a day) or placebo twice a day for up to six cycles. The primary end point was overall survival (OS) in the veliparib arm versus the control arm in current smokers, based on phase II findings. Archival tumor samples were provided for biomarker analysis using a 52-gene expression histology classifier (LP52). RESULTS Overall, 970 patients were randomly assigned to carboplatin and paclitaxel plus either veliparib (n = 486) or placebo (n = 484); 57% were current smokers. There was no significant OS benefit with veliparib in current smokers, with median OS 11.9 versus 11.1 months (hazard ratio LHRJ, 0.905; 95% CI, 0.744 to 1.101; P = .266). In the overall population, OS favored veliparib; median OS was 12.2 versus 11.2 months (HR, 0.853; 95% CI, 0.747 to 0.974), with no difference in progression-free survival (median 5.6 months per arm). In patients with biomarker-evaluable tumor samples (n = 360), OS favored veliparib in the LP52-positive population (median 14.0 v 9.6 months; HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.89), but favored placebo in the LP52-negative population (median 11.0 v 14.4 months; HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.86). No new safety signals were observed in the experimental arm. CONCLUSION In current smokers with advanced sqNSCLC, there was no therapeutic benefit of adding veliparib to first-line chemotherapy. The LP52 signature may identify a subgroup of patients likely to derive benefit from veliparib with chemotherapy.

Objective To compare the association of mental stress-induced or conventional stress-induced ischemia with adverse cardiovascular events in patients with CHD. Design, Setting, and Participants Pooled analysis of 2 prospective cohort studies of patients with stable CHD from a university-based hospital network in Atlanta, Georgia: the Mental Stress Ischemia Prognosis Study (MIPS) and the Myocardial Infarction and Mental Stress Study 2 (MIMS2). Participants were enrolled between June 2011 and March 2016 (last follow-up, February 2020). Exposures Provocation of myocardial ischemia with a standardized mental stress test (public speaking task) and with a conventional (exercise or pharmacological) stress test, using single-photon emission computed tomography. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death or first or recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction. The secondary end point additionally included hospitalizations for heart failure. Results Of the 918 patients in the total sample pool (mean age, 60 years; 34% women), 618 participated in MIPS and 300 in MIMS2. Of those, 147 patients (16%) had mental stress-induced ischemia, 281 (31%) conventional stress ischemia, and 96 (10%) had both. Over a 5-year median follow-up, the primary end point occurred in 156 participants. The pooled event rate was 6.9 per 100 patient-years among patients with and 2.6 per 100 patient-years among patients without mental stress-induced ischemia. The multivariable adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for patients with vs those without mental stress-induced ischemia was 2.5 (95% CI, 1.8-3.5). Compared with patients with no ischemia (event rate, 2.3 per 100 patient-years), patients with mental stress-induced ischemia alone had a significantly increased risk (event rate, 4.8 per 100 patient-years; HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.7) as did patients with both mental stress ischemia and conventional stress ischemia (event rate, 8.1 per 100 patient-years; HR, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.6-5.6). Patients with conventional stress ischemia alone did not have a significantly increased risk (event rate, 3.1 per 100 patient-years; HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.9-2.1). Patients with both mental stress ischemia and conventional stress ischemia had an elevated risk compared with patients with conventional stress ischemia alone (HR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.7-4.3). The secondary end point occurred in 319 participants. The event rate was 12.6 per 100 patient-years for patients with and 5.6 per 100 patient-years for patients without mental stress-induced ischemia (adjusted HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.5-2.5). Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with stable coronary heart disease, the presence of mental stress-induced ischemia, compared with no mental stress-induced ischemia, was significantly associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death or nonfatal myocardial infarction. Although these findings may provide insights into mechanisms of myocardial ischemia, further research is needed to assess whether testing for mental stress-induced ischemia has clinical value. This study examines whether mental stress-induced ischemia is related to adverse cardiovascular events in 2 parallel modern cohorts of patients with stable coronary heart disease. Question Is myocardial ischemia provoked by mental stress associated with adverse cardiovascular events in patients with coronary heart disease? Findings In this pooled analysis of 2 prospective cohort studies that included 918 participants, the presence of ischemia with mental stress, compared with no ischemia with mental stress, was significantly associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death or nonfatal myocardial infarction (hazard ratio, 2.5). Meaning Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia was significantly associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary heart disease, but further research is needed to assess whether testing for mental-stress ischemia has utility in clinical practice.",NOV 9,2021,326,18,1818,1828,,10.1001/jama.2021.17649,http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.2021.17649,,34751708,WOS:000718139200021,View Full Record in Web of Science

DNA vaccines can achieve these criteria, but induction of strong immune responses has often required bulky, expensive electroporation devices. Here, we report an ultra-low-cost (<1 USD), handheld (<50 g) electroporation system utilizing a microneedle electrode array (ePatch) for DNA vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. The low cost and small size are achieved by combining a thumb-operated piezoelectric pulser derived from a common household stove lighter that emits microsecond, bipolar, oscillatory electric pulses and a microneedle electrode array that targets delivery of high electric field strength pulses to the skin's epidermis. Antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 induced by this electroporation system in mice were strong and enabled at least 10-fold dose sparing compared to conventional intramuscular or intradermal injection of the DNA vaccine. Vaccination was well tolerated with mild, transient effects on the skin. This ePatch system is easily portable, without any battery or other power source supply, offering an attractive, inexpensive approach for rapid and accessible DNA vaccination to combat COVID-19, as well as other epidemics.",NOV 9,2021,118,45,,,e2110817118,10.1073/pnas.2110817118,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2110817118,,34670842,WOS:000720928400016,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we report the results of the phase 2 PrE0505 trial (NCT02899195) of the anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab plus platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy for 55 patients with previously untreated, unresectable pleural mesothelioma. The primary endpoint was overall survival compared to historical control with cisplatin and pemetrexed chemotherapy; secondary and exploratory endpoints included safety, progression-free survival and biomarkers of response. The combination of durvalumab with chemotherapy met the pre-specified primary endpoint, reaching a median survival of 20.4 months versus 12.1 months with historical control. Treatment-emergent adverse events were consistent with known side effects of chemotherapy, and all adverse events due to immunotherapy were grade 2 or lower. Integrated genomic and immune cell repertoire analyses revealed that a higher immunogenic mutation burden coupled with a more diverse T cell repertoire was linked to favorable clinical outcome. Structural genome-wide analyses showed a higher degree of genomic instability in responding tumors of epithelioid histology. Patients with germline alterations in cancer predisposing genes, especially those involved in DNA repair, were more likely to achieve long-term survival.

MITS improves the knowledge of causes of death (CoD) in resource-limited settings. Its implementation requires understanding the components of acceptability, including facilitators and barriers in real-case scenarios. Methods We undertook a mixed-methods analysis comparing anticipated (hypothetical scenario) and experienced (real-case scenario) acceptability of MITS among relatives of deceased children in Mozambique. Anticipated acceptability information was obtained from 15 interviews with relatives of deceased children. The interview focus was on whether and why they would allow the procedure on their dead child in a hypothetical scenario. Experienced acceptability data were obtained from outcomes of consent requested to relatives of 114 deceased children during MITS implementation, recorded through observations, clinical records abstraction and follow-up informal conversations with health care professionals and semistructured interviews with relatives. Results Ninety-three percent of relatives indicated that they would hypothetically accept MITS on their deceased child. A key reason was knowing the CoD to take preventive actions; whereas the need to conform with the norm of immediate child burial, the secrecy of perinatal deaths, the decision-making complexity, the misalignment between MITS' purpose and traditional values, lack of a credible reason to investigate CoD, and the impotency to resuscitate the deceased were identified as potential points of hesitancy for acceptance. The only refusing respondent linked MITS to a perception that sharing results would constitute a breach of confidentiality and the lack of value attached to CoD determination. Experienced acceptability revealed four different components: actual acceptance, health professionals' hesitancy, relatives' hesitancy and actual refusal, which resulted in 82% of approached relatives to agree with MITS and 79% of cases to undergo MITS. Barriers to acceptability included, among others, health professionals' and facilities' unpreparedness to perform MITS, the threat of not burying the child immediately, financial burden of delays, decision-making complexities and misalignment of MITS' objectives with family values. Conclusions MITS showed high anticipated and experienced acceptability driven by the opportunity to prevent further deaths. Anticipated acceptability identified secrecy, confidentiality and complex decision-making processes as barriers, while experienced acceptability revealed family- and health facility-level logistics and practical aspects as barriers. Health-system and logistical impediments must also be considered before MITS implementation. Additionally, the multiple components of acceptability must be taken into account to make it more consistent and transferrable.",NOV 8,2021,16,11,,,e0259621,10.1371/journal.pone.0259621,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0259621,,34748582,WOS:000755468000040,View Full Record in Web of Science

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association between vaccination with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines-mRNA-1273 (Moderna) and BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech)-and COVID-19 hospitalization, and, among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the association with progression to critical disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A US 21-site case-control analysis of 4513 adults hospitalized between March 11 and August 15, 2021, with 28-day outcome data on death and mechanical ventilation available for patients enrolled through July 14, 2021. Date of final follow-up was August 8, 2021. EXPOSURES COVID-19 vaccination. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Associations were evaluated between prior vaccination and (1) hospitalization for COVID-19, in which case patients were those hospitalized for COVID-19 and control patients were those hospitalized for an alternative diagnosis; and (2) disease progression among patients hospitalized for COVID-19, in which cases and controls were COVID-19 patients with and without progression to death or mechanical ventilation, respectively. Associations were measured with multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS Among 4513 patients (median age, 59 years [IQR, 45-69]; 2202 [48.8%] women; 23.0% non-Hispanic Black individuals, 15.9% Hispanic individuals, and 20.1% with an immunocompromising condition), 1983 were case patients with COVID-19 and 2530 were controls without COVID-19. Unvaccinated patients accounted for 84.2%(1669/1983) of COVID-19 hospitalizations. Hospitalization for COVID-19 was significantly associated with decreased likelihood of vaccination (cases, 15.8%; controls, 54.8%; adjusted OR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.13-0.18), including for sequenced SARS-CoV-2 Alpha (8.7% vs 51.7%; aOR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.06-0.16) and Delta variants (21.9% vs 61.8%; aOR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.10-0.21). This association was stronger for immunocompetent patients (11.2% vs 53.5%; aOR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.09-0.13) than immunocompromised patients(40.1%vs58.8%; aOR, 0.49;95% CI, 0.35-0.69)(P<.001) and weaker at more than 120 days since vaccination with BNT162b2 (5.8% vs 11.5%; aOR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.27-0.49) than with mRNA-1273 (1.9% vs 8.3%; aOR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.09-0.23) (P<.001).

The primary aim of this trial was to identify which of three MIBG regimens was likely associated with the highest true response rate. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients 1-30 years were eligible if they had relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma, at least one MIBG-avid site, and adequate autologous stem cells. Patients received MIBG 18 mCi/kg on day 1 and autologous stem cell on day 15. Patients randomly assigned to arm A received only MIBG; patients randomly assigned to arm B received intravenous vincristine on day 0 and irinotecan daily on days 0-4; patients randomly assigned to arm C received vorinostat (180 mg/m(2)/dose) orally once daily on days 1 to 12. The primary end point was response after one course by New Approaches to Neuroblastoma Therapy criteria. The trial was designed with 105 patients to ensure an 80% chance that the arm with highest response rate was selected. RESULTS One hundred fourteen patients were enrolled, with three ineligible and six unevaluable, leaving 105 eligible and evaluable patients (36 in arm A, 35 in arm B, and 34 in arm C; 55 boys; and median age 6.5 years). After one course, the response rates (partial response or better) on arms A, B, and C were 14% (95% CI, 5 to 30), 14% (5 to 31), and 32% (18 to 51). An additional five, five, and four patients met New Approaches to Neuroblastoma Therapy Minor Response criteria on arms A, B, and C, respectively. On arms A, B, and C, rates of any grade 3+ nonhematologic toxicity after first course were 19%, 49%, and 35%. CONCLUSION Vorinostat and MIBG is likely the arm with the highest true response rate, with manageable toxicity.

Blockade of PD-L1/PD-1 has been a major improvement in the treatment of certain cancers, however, the response rate to checkpoint blockade remains low suggesting a need for new therapies. Metformin has emerged as a potential new drug for the treatment of cancer due to its effects on PD-L1 expression, T cell responses, and the immunosuppressive environment within tumors. While the benefits of metformin in combination with checkpoint blockade have been reported in animal models, little remains known about its effect on other types of immunotherapy. Methods Vaccine immunotherapy and metformin were administered to mice inoculated with tumors to investigate the effect of metformin and TMV vaccine on tumor growth, metastasis, PD-L1 expression, immune cell infiltration, and CD8 T cell phenotype. The effect of metformin on IFN-gamma induced PD-L1 expression in tumor cells was assessed by flow cytometry, western blot, and RT-qPCR. Results We observed that tumors that respond to metformin and vaccine immunotherapy combination show a reduction in surface PD-L1 expression compared with tumor models that do not respond to metformin. In vitro assays showed that the effect of metformin on tumor cell PD-L1 expression was mediated in part by AMP-activated protein kinase signaling. Vaccination results in increased T cell infiltration in all tumor models, and this was not further enhanced by metformin. However, we observed an increased number of CD8 T cells expressing PD-1, Ki-67, Tim-3, and CD62L as well as increased effector cytokine production after treatment with metformin and tumor membrane vesicle vaccine. Conclusions Our data suggest that metformin can synergize with vaccine immunotherapy to augment the antitumor response through tumor-intrinsic mechanisms and also alter the phenotype and function of CD8 T cells within the tumor, which could provide insights for its use in the clinic.",NOV,2021,9,11,,,e002614,10.1136/jitc-2021-002614,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2021-002614,,34815353,WOS:000722307600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The MISpheroID Consortium developed a crowdsourcing knowledgebase that assembles the experimental parameters of 3,058 published spheroid-related experiments. Interrogation of this knowledgebase identified heterogeneity in the methodological setup of spheroids. Empirical evaluation and interlaboratory validation of selected variations in spheroid methodology revealed diverse impacts on spheroid metrics. To facilitate interpretation, stimulate transparency and increase awareness, the Consortium defines the MISpheroID string, a minimum set of experimental parameters required to report spheroid research.

For decades, harnessing a person's own immune system to fight cancer has been a major area of research in oncology. Recently, these efforts have proven successful with the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors; these agents have now become part of the routine care of NSCLC. Presently, five programmed cell death-1 and programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 inhibitors and one anti-cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte-4 inhibitor are US Food and Drug Administration-approved in the treatment of NSCLC. These drugs have made a dramatic difference in the lives of patients with NSCLC, although durable benefits are limited to a subset of patients. In this review, we highlight the trials that led to our current treatment practices, discuss areas of active research, and address common clinical issues that have risen as immune therapy has become a mainstay of treatment in NSCLC.

Additional proteins increase the probability of looping, but these probabilities maintain a broad distribution. For example, the probability of lac repressor-mediated looping in individual molecules ranged 0-100%, and individual molecules exhibited representative behavior only in observations lasting an hour or more. Titrating with HU protein progressively compacted the DNA without narrowing the 0-100% distribution. Increased negative supercoiling produced an ensemble of molecules in which all individual molecules more closely resembled the average. Furthermore, in only 12 min of observation, well within the doubling time of the bacterium, most molecules exhibited the looping probability of the ensemble.

Public places remain hotspots for COVID-19 transmission due to large numbers of people present; however preventive measures are poorly enforced. Supermarkets are among the high-risk establishments due to the high interactions involved, which makes compliance with the COVID-19 preventive guidelines of paramount importance. However, until now, there has been limited evidence on compliance with the set COVID-19 prevention guidelines. Therefore, this study aimed to measure compliance with the COVID-19 prevention guidelines among supermarkets in Kampala Capital City and Mukono Municipality Uganda. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among selected supermarkets in Kampala Capital City and Mukono Municipality in September 2020. A total of 229 supermarkets (195 in Kampala City and 34 in Mukono Municipality) were randomly selected for the study. Data were collected through structured observations on the status of compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines, and entered using the KoboCollect software, which was preinstalled on mobile devices (smart phones and tablets). Descriptive statistics were generated to measure compliance to the set COVID-19 Ministry of Health prevention guidelines using Stata 14 software. Results Only 16.6% (38/229) of the supermarkets complied with the COVID-19 prevention and control guidelines. In line with the specific measures, almost all supermarkets 95.2% (218/229) had hand washing facilities placed at strategic points such as the entrance, and 59.8% (137/ 229) of the supermarkets surveyed regularly disinfected commonly touched surfaces. Only 40.6% and 30.6% of the supermarkets enforced mandatory hand washing and use of face masks respectively for all customers accessing the premises. Slightly more than half, 52.4% (120/229) of the supermarkets had someone or a team in charge of enforcing compliance to COVID-19 measures and more than half, 55.5% (127/229) of the supermarkets had not provided their staff with job-specific training/mentorship on infection prevention and control for COVID-19. Less than a third, 26.2% (60/229) of the supermarkets had an infrared temperature gun for screening every customer, and only 5.7% (13/229) of the supermarkets captured details of clients accessing the supermarket as a measure to ease follow-up. Conclusion This study revealed low compliance with COVID-19 guidelines, which required mandatory preventive measures such as face masking, regular disinfection, social distancing, and hand hygiene. This study suggests the need for health authorities to strengthen enforcement of these guidelines, and to sensitise the supermarket managers on COVID-19 in order to increase the uptake of the different measures.",OCT 28,2021,16,10,,,e0258840,10.1371/journal.pone.0258840,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0258840,,34710126,WOS:000755563200040,View Full Record in Web of Science

Patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) have a high burden of symptoms and functional limitations, and have a poor quality of life. By targeting cardiometabolic abmormalities, sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors may improve these impairments. In this multicenter, randomized trial of patients with HFpEF (NCT03030235), we evaluated whether the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin improves the primary endpoint of Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score (KCCQ-CS), a measure of heart failure-related health status, at 12 weeks after treatment initiation. Secondary endpoints included the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), KCCQ Overall Summary Score (KCCQ-OS), clinically meaningful changes in KCCQ-CS and -OS, and changes in weight, natriuretic peptides, glycated hemoglobin and systolic blood pressure. In total, 324 patients were randomized to dapagliflozin or placebo. Dapagliflozin improved KCCQ-CS (effect size, 5.8 points (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.3-9.2, P = 0.001), meeting the predefined primary endpoint, due to improvements in both KCCQ total symptom score (KCCQ-TS) (5.8 points (95% CI 2.0-9.6, P = 0.003)) and physical limitations scores (5.3 points (95% CI 0.7-10.0, P = 0.026)). Dapagliflozin also improved 6MWT (mean effect size of 20.1 m (95% CI 5.6-34.7, P = 0.007)), KCCQ-OS (4.5 points (95% CI 1.1-7.8, P = 0.009)), proportion of participants with 5-point or greater improvements in KCCQ-OS (odds ratio (OR) = 1.73 (95% CI 1.05-2.85, P = 0.03)) and reduced weight (mean effect size, 0.72 kg (95% CI 0.01-1.42, P = 0.046)). There were no significant differences in other secondary endpoints. Adverse events were similar between dapagliflozin and placebo (44 (27.2%) versus 38 (23.5%) patients, respectively).

Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Setting and Participants: N/A. Measures: N/A. Methods: Data sources-relevant randomized control trials (RCTs) were identified by a systematic search of databases including Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Cochrane. RCTs were selected first based on title and abstract review and then on full-text review by independent reviewers using predefined eligibility criteria. Risk of bias (RoB) was assessed using the Cochrane RoB tool and funnel plots. The primary outcome variable was the composite score of global cognitive function. Results: A total of 909 participants with mild cognitive impairment or dementia from 16 RCTs were included in the systematic review. The study quality was modest, and the RoB assessment showed bias in blinding the participants and personnel. Funnel plots showed no evidence of publication bias. The meta-analysis of 14 RCTs revealed no superior effect of brain gaming compared to other interventions on global cognitive function (pooled standardized mean difference = 0.08, 95% confidence interval -0.24, 0.41, P = .61, I-2 = 77%). Likewise, no superior effects were found on the cognitive domains of memory, executive function, visuospatial skills, and language. Conclusion and Implications: The findings of this meta-analysis suggest that brain gaming compared with the control intervention does not show significant improvement in standardized tests of cognitive function. Because of considerable heterogeneity in sample size, gaming platform, cognitive status, study design, assessment tools, and training prescription, we cannot confidently refute the premise that brain gaming is an effective cognitive training approach for older adults with cognitive impairments.

However, the potential for an effective response by innate lymphocyte effectors such as NK and gamma delta T cells that recognize NKG2DL is limited by the drug's concomitant lymphodepleting effects. We have previously shown that modification of gamma delta T cells with a methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) transgene confers TMZ resistance via production of O-6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) thereby enabling gamma delta T cell function in therapeutic concentrations of TMZ. In this study, we tested this strategy which we have termed Drug Resistant Immunotherapy (DRI) to examine whether combination therapy of TMZ and MGMT-modified gamma delta T cells could improve survival outcomes in four human/mouse xenograft models of primary and refractory GBM. Our results confirm that DRI leverages the innate response of gamma delta T cells to chemotherapy-induced stress associated antigen expression and achieves synergies that are significantly greater than either individual approach.",OCT 26,2021,11,1,,,21133,10.1038/s41598-021-00536-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-00536-8,,34702850,WOS:000711622600059,View Full Record in Web of Science

Serum samples (baseline, 12 weeks) were drawn from participants (n = 196) randomized to treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), escitalopram, or duloxetine for major depressive disorder. Baseline indoxyl sulfate abundance was positively correlated with severity of psychic anxiety and total anxiety and with resting state functional connectivity to a network that processes aversive stimuli (which includes the subcallosal cingulate cortex (SCC-FC), bilateral anterior insula, right anterior midcingulate cortex, and the right premotor areas). The relation between indoxyl sulfate and psychic anxiety was mediated only through the metabolite's effect on the SCC-FC with the premotor area. Baseline indole abundances were unrelated to post-treatment outcome measures, and changes in symptoms were not correlated with changes in indole concentrations. These results suggest that CBT and antidepressant medications relieve anxiety via mechanisms unrelated to modulation of indoles derived from gut microbiota; it remains possible that treatment-related improvement stems from their impact on other aspects of the gut microbiome. A peripheral gut microbiome-derived metabolite was associated with altered neural processing and with psychiatric symptom (anxiety) in humans, which provides further evidence that gut microbiome disruption can contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders that may require different therapeutic approaches.

Although a limited number of SARS-CoV-2 introductions were reported in January and February 2020 (refs.(8,9)), the narrowness of the initial testing criteria, combined with a slow growth in testing capacity and porous travel screening(10), left many countries vulnerable to unmitigated, cryptic transmission. Here we use a global metapopulation epidemic model to provide a mechanistic understanding of the early dispersal of infections and the temporal windows of the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 and onset of local transmission in Europe and the USA. We find that community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was likely to have been present in several areas of Europe and the USA by January 2020, and estimate that by early March, only 1 to 4 in 100 SARS-CoV-2 infections were detected by surveillance systems. The modelling results highlight international travel as the key driver of the introduction of SARS-CoV-2, with possible introductions and transmission events as early as December 2019 to January 2020. We find a heterogeneous geographic distribution of cumulative infection attack rates by 4 July 2020, ranging from 0.78% to 15.2% across US states and 0.19% to 13.2% in European countries.

To treat these complications, their underlying etiology and drug treatments must be identified. Thus, a novel AI methodology MOATAI-VIR, which predicts disease-protein-pathway relationships and repurposed FDA-approved drugs to treat COVID-19's clinical manifestations was developed. SARS-CoV-2 interacting human proteins and GWAS identified respiratory failure genes provide the input from which the mode-of-action (MOA) proteins/pathways of the resulting disease comorbidities are predicted. These comorbidities are then mapped to their clinical manifestations. To assess each manifestation's molecular basis, their prioritized shared proteins were subject to global pathway analysis. Next, the molecular features associated with hallmark COVID-19 phenotypes, e.g. unusual neurological symptoms, cytokine storms, and blood clots were explored. In practice, 24/26 of the major clinical manifestations are successfully predicted. Three major uncharacterized manifestation categories including neoplasms are also found. The prevalence of neoplasms suggests that SARS-CoV-2 might be an oncovirus due to shared molecular mechanisms between oncogenesis and viral replication. Then, repurposed FDA-approved drugs that might treat COVID-19's clinical manifestations are predicted by virtual ligand screening of the most frequent comorbid protein targets.

The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), a family C GPCR, regulates systemic calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis that is critical for many physiological, calciotropical, and noncalciotropical outcomes in multiple organs. However, the mechanisms by which extracellular Ca2+ (Ca-ex(2+)) and the CaSR mediate networks of intracellular Ca2+-signaling and players involved throughout the life cycle of CaSR are largely unknown. Here we report the first CaSR protein-protein interactome with 94 novel putative and 8 previously published interactors using proteomics. Ca-ex(2+) promotes enrichment of 66% of the identified CaSR interactors, pertaining to Ca2+ dynamics, endocytosis, degradation, trafficking, and primarily to protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These enhanced ER-related processes are governed by Ca-ex(2+)-activated CaSR which directly modulates ER-Ca2+ (Ca-ER(2+)), as monitored by a novel ER targeted Ca2+-sensor. Moreover, we validated the Ca-ex(2+) dependent colocalizations and interactions of CaSR with ER-protein processing chaperone, 78-kDa glucose regulated protein (GRP78), and with trafficking-related protein. Live cell imaging results indicated that CaSR and vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated A (VAPA) are inter-dependent during Ca-ex(2+) induced enhancement of nearCell membrane expression.

We collected early and late pregnancy urine samples for cotinine measurement and serum samples for high-resolution metabolomics (HRM) profiling from 105 pregnant women from the Atlanta African American Maternal-Child cohort (2014-2016). Maternal metabolome perturbations mediating prenatal tobacco smoke exposure and adverse birth outcomes were assessed by an untargeted HRM workflow using generalized linear models, followed by pathway enrichment analysis and chemical annotation, with a meet-in-the-middle approach. The median maternal urinary cotinine concentrations were 5.93 mu g/g creatinine and 3.69 mu g/g creatinine in early and late pregnancy, respectively. In total, 16,481 and 13,043 metabolic features were identified in serum samples at each visit from positive and negative electrospray ionization modes, respectively. Twelve metabolic pathways were found to be associated with both cotinine concentrations and adverse birth outcomes during early and late pregnancy, including tryptophan, histidine, urea cycle, arginine, and proline metabolism. We confirmed 47 metabolites associated with cotinine levels, preterm birth, and shorter gestational age, including glutamate, serine, choline, and taurine, which are closely involved in endogenous inflammation, vascular reactivity, and lipid peroxidation processes. The metabolic perturbations associated with cotinine levels were related to inflammation, oxidative stress, placental vascularization, and insulin action, which could contribute to shorter gestations.

To overcome this limitation, we leveraged the distinct temporal regulation of Calbindin (Calb1) expression in RCs to create genetic models for timed RC manipulation. We used a Calb1 allele expressing a destabilized Cre (dgCre) theoretically active only upon trimethoprim (TMP) administration. TMP timing and dose influenced RC targeting efficiency, which was highest within the first three postnatal weeks, but specificity was low with many other spinal neurons also targeted. In addition, dgCre showed TMP-independent activity resulting in spontaneous recombination events that accumulated with age. Combining Calb1-dgCre with Parvalbumin (Pvalb) or Engrailed1 (En1) Flpo alleles in dual conditional systems increased cellular and timing specificity. Under optimal conditions, Calb1-dgCre/Pvalb-Flpo mice targeted 90% of RCs and few dorsal horn neurons; Calb1-dgCre/En1-Flpo mice showed higher specificity, but only a maximum of 70% of RCs targeted.

County Median Income Changes and Low Birth Weight Rates Among Births to Black and White Mothers,MILBANK QUARTERLY,Article,"Policy Points Policies that increase county income levels, particularly for middle-income households, may reduce low birth weight rates and shrink disparities between Black and White infants. Given the role of aggregate maternal characteristics in predicting low birth weight rates, policies that increase human capital investments (e.g., funding for higher education, job training) could lead to higher income levels while improving population birth outcomes. The association between county income levels and racial disparities in low birth weight is independent of disparities in maternal risks, and thus a broad set of policies aimed at increasing income levels (e.g., income supplements, labor protections) may be warranted. Context Low birth weight (LBW; <2,500 grams) and infant mortality rates vary among place and racial group in the United States, with economic resources being a likely fundamental contributor to these disparities. The goals of this study were to examine time-varying county median income as a predictor of LBW rates and Black-White LBW disparities and to test county prevalence and racial disparities in maternal sociodemographic and health risk factors as mediators. Methods Using national birth records for 1992-2014 from the National Center for Health Statistics, a total of approximately 27.4 million singleton births to non-Hispanic Black and White mothers were included. Data were aggregated in three-year county-period observations for 868 US counties meeting eligibility requirements (n = 3,723 observations). Sociodemographic factors included rates of low maternal education, nonmarital childbearing, teenage pregnancy, and advanced-age pregnancy; and health factors included rates of smoking during pregnancy and inadequate prenatal care. Among other covariates, linear models included county and period fixed effects and unemployment, poverty, and income inequality. Findings An increase of $10,000 in county median income was associated with 0.34 fewer LBW cases per 100 live births and smaller Black-White LBW disparities of 0.58 per 100 births. Time-varying county rates of maternal sociodemographic and health risks mediated the association between median income and LBW, accounting for 65% and 25% of this estimate, respectively, but racial disparities in risk factors did not mediate the income association with Black-White LBW disparities. Similarly, county median income was associated with very low birth weight rates and related Black-White disparities. Conclusions Efforts to increase income levels-for example, through investing in human capital, enacting labor union protections, or attracting well-paying employment-have broad potential to influence population reproductive health. Higher income levels may reduce LBW rates and lead to more equitable outcomes between Black and White mothers.",MAR,2022,100,1,38,77,,10.1111/1468-0009.12532,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1468-0009.12532,OCT 2021,34609027,WOS:000713640700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

There is limited data on exposure reductions achieved by switching from solid to clean cooking fuels in rural settings across multiple countries. As formative research in 2017, we recruited pregnant women and characterized the impact of the intervention on personal exposures and kitchen levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in Guatemala, India, and Rwanda. Forty pregnant women were enrolled in each site. We measured cooking area concentrations of and personal exposures to PM2.5 for 24 or 48 h using gravimetric-based PM2.5 samplers at baseline and two followups over two months after delivery of an LPG cookstove and free fuel supply. Mixed models were used to estimate PM2.5 reductions. Median kitchen PM2.5 concentrations were 296 mu g/m(3) at baseline (interquartile range, IQR: 158 507), 24 mu g/m(3) at first follow-up (IQR: 18 37), and 23 mu g/m(3) at second follow-up (IQR: 14 37). Median personal exposures to PM2.5 were 134 mu g/m(3) at baseline (IQR: 71 224), 35 mu g/m(3) at first follow-up (IQR: 23 51), and 32 mu g/m(3) at second follow-up (IQR: 23-47). Overall, the LPG intervention was associated with a 92% (95% confidence interval (CI): 90-94%) reduction in kitchen PM 25 concentrations and a 74% (95% CI: 70-79%) reduction in personal PM2.5 exposures. Results were similar for each site. Conclusions: The intervention was associated with substantial reductions in kitchen and personal PM2.5 overall and in all sites. Results suggest LPG interventions in these rural settings may lower exposures to the WHO annual interim target-1 of 35 mu g/m(3). The range of exposure contrasts falls on steep sections of estimated exposure-response curves for birthweight, blood pressure, and acute lower respiratory infections, implying potentially important health benefits when transitioning from solid fuels to LPG.",DEC 15,2021,291,,,,118198,10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118198,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118198,OCT 2021,34740288,WOS:000711660500006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Mounting evidence shows that deaths at the hands of the police disproportionately impact people of certain races and ethnicities, pointing to systemic racism in policing. Recent high-profile killings by police in the USA have prompted calls for more extensive and public data reporting on police violence. This study examines the presence and extent of under-reporting of police violence in US Government-run vital registration data, offers a method for correcting under-reporting in these datasets, and presents revised estimates of deaths due to police violence in the USA. Methods We compared data from the USA National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) to three non-governmental, opensource databases on police violence: Fatal Encounters, Mapping Police Violence, and The Counted. We extracted and standardised the age, sex, US state of death registration, year of death, and race and ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic of other races, and Hispanic of any race) of each decedent for all data sources and used a network meta-regression to quantify the rate of under-reporting within the NVSS. Using these rates to inform correction factors, we provide adjusted estimates of deaths due to police violence for all states, ages, sexes, and racial and ethnic groups from 1980 to 2019 across the USA. Findings Across all races and states in the USA, we estimate 30 800 deaths (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 30 300-31 300) from police violence between 1980 and 2018; this represents 17 100 more deaths (16 600-17 600) than reported by the NVSS. Over this time period, the age-standardised mortality rate due to police violence was highest in non-Hispanic Black people (0.69 [95% UI 0.67-0.71] per 100 000), followed by Hispanic people of any race (0.35 [0.34-0.36]), nonHispanic White people (0.20 [0.19-0.20]), and non-Hispanic people of other races (0.15 [0.14- 0.16]). This variation is further affected by the decedent's sex and shows large discrepancies between states. Between 1980 and 2018, the NVSS did not report 55.5% (54.8-56.2) of all deaths attributable to police violence. When aggregating all races, the age-standardised mortality rate due to police violence was 0.25 (0.24-0.26) per 100 000 in the 1980s and 0.34 (0.34-0.35) per 100 000 in the 2010s, an increase of 38.4% (32.4-45.1) over the period of study. Interpretation We found that more than half of all deaths due to police violence that we estimated in the USA from 1980 to 2018 were unreported in the NVSS. Compounding this, we found substantial differences in the agestandardised mortality rate due to police violence over time and by racial and ethnic groups within the USA. Proven public health intervention strategies are needed to address these systematic biases. State-level estimates allow for appropriate targeting of these strategies to address police violence and improve its reporting. Copyright (C) 2021 The Author(s).

This study aimed to estimate the OR describing the association between pathogen detection in stool and diarrhoea for 15 common enteropathogens by age group and child mortality setting. Methods We did a systematic review to identify case-control and cohort studies published from Jan 1, 1990, to July 9, 2019, which examined at least one enteropathogen of interest and the outcome diarrhoea. The analytical dataset included data extracted from published articles and supplemented with data from the Global Enteric Multicenter Study and the Malnutrition and Enteric Disease study. Random effects meta-analysis models were fit for each enteropathogen, stratified by age group and child mortality level, and adjusted for pathogen detection method and study design to produce summary ORs describing the association between pathogen detection in stool and diarrhoea. Findings 1964 records were screened and 130 studies (over 88 079 cases or diarrhoea samples and 135 755 controls or non-diarrhoea samples) were available for analysis. Heterogeneity (I-2) in unadjusted models was substantial, ranging from 27.6% to 86.6% across pathogens. In stratified and adjusted models, summary ORs varied by age group and setting, ranging from 0.4 (95% CI 0.2-0.6) for Giardia lamblia to 54.1 (95% CI 7. 4-393. 5) for Vibrio cholerae. Interpretation Incorporating effect estimates from diverse data sources into diarrhoeal disease cause and burden of disease models is needed to produce more representative estimates.

These ligand-gated ion channels are critical to brain function and are centrally implicated in numerous psychiatric and neurologic disorders. There are different classes of iGluRs with a variety of receptor subtypes in each class that play distinct roles in neuronal functions. The diversity in iGluR subtypes, with their unique functional properties and physiologic roles, has motivated a large number of studies. Our understanding of receptor subtypes has advanced considerably since the first iGluR subunit gene was cloned in 1989, and the research focus has expanded to encompass facets of biology that have been recently discovered and to exploit experimental paradigms made possible by technological advances. Here, we review insights from more than 3 decades of iGluR studies with an emphasis on the progress that has occurred in the past decade. We cover structure, function, pharmacology, roles in neurophysiology, and therapeutic implications for all classes of receptors assembled from the subunits encoded by the 18 ionotropic glutamate receptor genes. Significance Statement--Glutamate receptors play important roles in virtually all aspects of brain function and are either involved in mediating some clinical features of neurological disease or represent a therapeutic target for treatment. Therefore, understanding the structure, function, and pharmacology of this class of receptors will advance our understanding of many aspects of brain function at molecular, cellular, and system levels and provide new opportunities to treat patients.",OCT,2021,73,4,298,487,,10.1124/pharmrev.120.000131,http://dx.doi.org/10.1124/pharmrev.120.000131,,,WOS:000741493500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The objective was to compare characteristics of articles exhibiting authorship parasitism in sub-Saharan Africa to articles with author representation from sub-Saharan African countries. Methods A bibliometric review of articles indexed in PubMed published from January 2014 through December 2018 reporting research conducted in sub-Saharan Africa was performed. Author affiliations were assigned to countries based on regular expression algorithms. Choropleth maps and network diagrams were created to determine where authorship parasitism occurred, and multivariable logistic regression was used to determine associated factors. Results Of 32 061 articles, 14.8% (n=4754) demonstrated authorship parasitism, which was most common among studies from Somalia (n=175/233, 75.1%) and Sao Tome and Principe (n=20/28, 71.4%). Authors affiliated with USA and UK institutions were most commonly involved in articles exhibiting authorship parasitism. Authorship parasitism was more common in articles: published in North American journals (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.26, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.50) than in sub-Saharan African journals, reporting work from multiple sub-Saharan African countries (aOR 8.41, 95% CI 7.30 to 9.68) compared with work from upper-middle income sub-Saharan African countries, with <5 authors (aOR 14.46, 95% CI 12.81 to 16.35) than >10 authors, and was less common in articles published in French (aOR 0.60, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.85) than English. Conclusions Authorship parasitism was common in articles reporting research conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. There were reliable predictors of authorship parasitism.

The expression of PDL1 on multiple subsets of monocytes as well as their associations with cytokines and microbial products have not been well studied. Method HIV (TB-HIV+), TB (TB+HIV-) and TB/HIV co-infected (TB+HIV+) patients as well as apparently healthy controls (TB-HIV-) were recruited. TB and HIV patients were treatment naive while TB/HIV patients were both ART naive and experienced but not yet started TB therapy. Monocyte subsets were evaluated for PDL1 expression by flow cytometry; plasma TNF alpha, IL6, IP10, IFN gamma and IL10 were measured by Luminex; and cytokine mRNA from purified monocytes quantitated by qPCR. The association of PDL1 with cytokines, clinical and microbial indices, including HIV viral load, TB smear microscopy and TB urinary lipoarabinomannan (LAM) were assessed. Results Monocyte expression of PDL1 was significantly higher in TB, HIV and TB/HIV co-infected patients compared with healthy controls (p = 0.0001), with the highest levels in TB/HIV co-infected patients. The highest expression of PDL1 was on intermediate (CD14+CD16+) monocytes in all participant groups. PDL1 strongly correlated with HIV viral load in TB/HIV while weakly correlated in HIV. PDL1 levels moderately correlated with plasma TNF alpha, IL6, IP10, IFN gamma and IL10 level in TB subjects whereas weakly correlated with TNF alpha and IP10 in HIV patients. However, cytokine mRNA from purified monocytes showed no association with either plasma cytokines or monocyte PDL1 expression, implying that if cytokines modulate PDL1, they are likely not originating from circulating monocytes themselves.

This study sought to determine the prevalence of RLS, associated clinical correlates, and characterize sleep-related differences in men with and without HIV. Methods Sleep-related data were collected in men who have sex with men participating in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS). Demographic, health behaviors, HIV status, comorbidities, and serological data were obtained from the MACS visit coinciding with sleep assessments. Participants completed questionnaires, home polysomnography, and wrist actigraphy. RLS status was determined with the Cambridge-Hopkins RLS questionnaire. RLS prevalence was compared in men with and without HIV. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine correlates of RLS among all participants and men with HIV alone. Sleep-related differences were examined in men with and without HIV by RLS status. Results The sample consisted of 942 men (56% HIV+; mean age 57 years; 69% white). The prevalence of definite RLS was comparable in men with and without HIV (9.1% vs 8.7%). In multinomial regression, HIV status was not associated with RLS prevalence. However, white race, anemia, depression, and antidepressant use were each independently associated with RLS. HIV disease duration was also associated with RLS. Men with HIV and RLS reported poorer sleep quality, greater sleepiness, and had worse objective sleep efficiency/fragmentation than men without HIV/RLS.

Whether existing US Environmental Protection Agency standards are sufficient to protect health is unclear. Our study aimed to examine the relationship between exposure to lower concentrations of air pollution and the risk of mortality. Methods Our nationwide cohort study investigated the effect of annual average exposure to air pollutants on all-cause mortality among Medicare enrolees from the beginning of 2000 to the end of 2016. Patients entered the cohort in the month of January following enrolment and were followed up until the end of the study period in 2016 or death. We restricted our analyses to participants who had only been exposed to lower concentrations of pollutants over the study period, specifically particulate matter less than 2.5 mu g/m(3) in diameter (PM2.5) at a concentration of up to 12 mu g/m(3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) at a concentration of up to 53 parts per billion (ppb), and summer ozone (O-3) at concentrations of up to 50 ppb. We adjusted for two types of covariates, which were individual level and postal code-level variables. We used a doubly-robust additive model to estimate the change in risk. We further looked at effect-measure modification by stratification on the basis of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Findings We found an increased risk of mortality with all three pollutants. Each 1 mu g/m(3) increase in annual PM2.5 concentrations increased the absolute annual risk of death by 0.073% (95% CI 0.071-0.076). Each 1 ppb increase in annual NO2 concentrations increased the annual risk of death by 0.003% (0.003-0.004), and each 1 ppb increase in summer O-3 concentrations increased the annual risk of death by 0.081% (0.080-0.083). This increase translated to approximately 11540 attributable deaths (95% CI 11 087-11 992) for PM2.5, 1176 attributable deaths (998-1353) for NO2, and 15115 attributable deaths (14 896-15 333) for O-3 per year for each unit increase in pollution concentrations. The effects were higher in certain subgroups, including individuals living in areas of low socioeconomic status. Longterm exposure to permissible concentrations of air pollutants increases the risk of mortality. Copyright (C) 2021 The Author(s).

BC-CosmcKO mice display multiple phenotypic abnormalities, including severe weight loss, ocular manifestations, lymphadenopathy, and increased female-associated mortality. Disruption of B cell tolerance in BC-CosmcKO mice is manifested as elevated self-reactive IgM and IgG autoantibodies. Cosmc-deficient B cells exhibit enhanced basal activation and responsiveness to stimuli. There is also an elevated frequency of spontaneous germinal center B cells in BC-CosmcKO mice. Mechanistically, loss of Cosmc confers enhanced B cell receptor (BCR) signaling through diminished BCR internalization.

We aimed to examine patient selection, treatments, outcomes, and ECMO centre characteristics over the course of the pandemic to date. Methods We retrospectively analysed the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Registry and COVID-19 Addendum to compare three groups of ECMO-supported patients with COVID-19 (aged >= 16 years). At early-adopting centres-ie, those using ECMO support for COVID-19 throughout 2020-we compared patients who started ECMO on or before May 1, 2020 (group A1), and between May 2 and Dec 31, 2020 (group A2). Late-adopting centres were those that provided ECMO for COVID-19 only after May 1, 2020 (group B). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality in a time-to-event analysis assessed 90 days after ECMO initiation. A Cox proportional hazards model was fit to compare the patient and centre-level adjusted relative risk of mortality among the groups. Findings In 2020, 4812 patients with COVID-19 received ECMO across 349 centres within 41 countries. For earlyadopting centres, the cumulative incidence of in-hospital mortality 90 days after ECMO initiation was 36.9% (95% CI 34.1-39.7) in patients who started ECMO on or before May 1 (group A1) versus 51.9% (50.0-53.8) after May 1 (group A2); at late-adopting centres (group B), it was 58.9% (55.4-62.3). Relative to patients in group A2, group A1 patients had a lower adjusted relative risk of in-hospital mortality 90 days after ECMO (hazard ratio 0.82 [0.70-0.96]), whereas group B patients had a higher adjusted relative risk (1.42 [1.17-1.73]).

However, little is known about the host-parasite interactions and molecular mechanisms in play during the course of P. knowlesi malaria infections, which also may be relevant across Plasmodium species. Here we contrast P. knowlesi sporozoite-initiated infections in Macaca mulatta and Macaca fascicularis using whole blood RNA-sequencing and transcriptomic analysis. These macaque hosts are evolutionarily close, yet malaria-naive M. mulatta will succumb to blood-stage infection without treatment, whereas malaria-naive M. fascicularis controls parasitemia without treatment. This comparative analysis reveals transcriptomic differences as early as the liver phase of infection, in the form of signaling pathways that are activated in M. fascicularis, but not M. mulatta. Additionally, while most immune responses are initially similar during the acute stage of the blood infection, significant differences arise subsequently. The observed differences point to prolonged inflammation and anti-inflammatory effects of IL10 in M. mulatta, while M. fascicularis undergoes a transcriptional makeover towards cell proliferation, consistent with its recovery. Together, these findings suggest that timely detection of P. knowlesi in M. fascicularis, coupled with control of inflammation while initiating the replenishment of key cell populations, helps contain the infection. Overall, this study points to specific genes and pathways that could be investigated as a basis for new drug targets that support recovery from acute malaria.",SEP 30,2021,11,1,,,19519,10.1038/s41598-021-98024-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-98024-6,,34593836,WOS:000702737500128,View Full Record in Web of Science

In Patiria miniata (starfish) oocytes under in vitro experimental conditions (with overexpressed Ect2, induced expression of Delta 90 cyclin B, and roscovitine treatment), such activity generates multiple co-existing regions of coherent propagation of actin waves. Here we use computational modeling to investigate the development and properties of such wave domains. The model reveals that the formation of wave domains requires a balance between the activation and inhibition in the Rho signaling motif. Intriguingly, the development of the wave domains is preceded by a stage of low-activity quasi-static patterns, which may not be readily observed in experiments. Spatiotemporal patterns of this stage and the different paths of their destabilization define the behavior of the system in the later high-activity (observable) stage. Accounting for a strong intrinsic noise allowed us to achieve good quantitative agreement between simulated dynamics in different parameter regimes of the model and different wave dynamics in Patiria miniata and wild type Xenopus laevis (frog) data.

Recent work found that the active form of DJ-1 was induced in the ischemic heart as an endogenous mechanism to attenuate glycative stress-the non-enzymatic glycosylation of proteins. However, specific proteins protected from glycative stress by DJ-1 are not known. Given that mitochondrial electron transport proteins have a propensity for being targets of glycative stress, we investigated if DJ-1 regulates the glycation of Complex I and Complex III after myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Initial studies found that DJ-1 localized to the mitochondria and increased its interaction with Complex I and Complex III 3 days after the onset of myocardial I/R injury. Next, we investigated the role DJ-1 plays in modulating glycative stress in the mitochondria. Analysis revealed that compared to wild-type control mice, mitochondria from DJ-1 deficient (DJ-1 KO) hearts showed increased levels of glycative stress following I/R. Additionally, Complex I and Complex III glycation were found to be at higher levels in DJ-1 KO hearts. This corresponded with reduced complex activities, as well as reduced mitochondrial oxygen consumption ant ATP synthesis in the presence of pyruvate and malate. To further determine if DJ-1 influenced the glycation of the complexes, an adenoviral approach was used to over-express the active form of DJ-1(AAV9-DJ1 Delta C). Under I/R conditions, the glycation of Complex I and Complex III were attenuated in hearts treated with AAV9-DJ1 Delta C. This was accompanied by improvements in complex activities, oxygen consumption, and ATP production. Together, this data suggests that cardiac DJ-1 maintains Complex I and Complex III efficiency and mitochondrial function during the recovery from I/R injury.

In the present study, we introduce machine learning as a novel tool that incorporates additional prognostic factors to improve the current TNM staging system. Methods and findings Cancer-specific survival data for cutaneous melanoma with at least a 5 years follow-up were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program of the National Cancer Institute and split into the training set (40,781 cases) and validation set (5,390 cases). Five factors were studied: the primary tumor (T), regional lymph nodes (N), distant metastasis (M), age (A), and sex (S). The Ensemble Algorithm for Clustering Cancer Data (EACCD) was applied to the training set to generate prognostic groups. Utilizing only T, N, and M, a basic prognostic system was built where patients were stratified into 10 prognostic groups with well-separated survival curves, similar to 10 AJCC stages. These 10 groups had a significantly higher accuracy in survival prediction than 10 stages (C-index = 0.7682 vs 0.7643; increase in C-index = 0.0039, 95% CI = (0.0032, 0.0047); p-value = 7.2x10(-23)). Nevertheless, a positive association remained between the EACCD grouping and the AJCC staging (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient = 0.8316; p-value = 4.5x10(-13)). With additional information from A and S, a more advanced prognostic system was established using the training data that stratified patients into 10 groups and further improved the prediction accuracy (C-index = 0.7865 vs 0.7643; increase in C-index = 0.0222, 95% CI = (0.0191, 0.0254); p-value = 8.8x10(-43) ). Both internal validation using the training set and temporal validation using the validation set showed good stratification and a high predictive accuracy of the prognostic systems.

Participants randomized to placebo received an open-label subcutaneous saline injection in the back; participants randomized to usual care continued their routine, ongoing care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES One-week mean back pain intensity score (0 to 10) at posttreatment, pain beliefs, and fMRI measures of evoked pain and resting connectivity. RESULTS At baseline, 151adults (54% female; mean [SD] age, 41.1 [15.6] years) reported mean (SD) pain of low to moderate severity (mean [SD] pain intensity, 4.10 [126] of 10; mean [SD] disability, 23.34 [10.12] of 100) and mean (SD) pain duration of 10.0 (8.9) years. Large group differences in pain were observed at posttreatment, with a mean (SD) pain score of 1.18 (1.24) in the PRT group, 2.84 (1.64) in the placebo group, and 3.13 (1.45) in the usual care group. Hedges g was -1.14 for PRT vs placebo and -1.74 for PRT vs usual care (P < .001). Of 151 total participants, 33 of 50 participants (66%) randomized to PRT were pain-free or nearly pain-free at posttreatment (reporting a pain intensity score of 0 or 1of 10), compared with 10 of 51 participants (20%) randomized to placebo and 5 of 50 participants (10%) randomized to usual care. Treatment effects were maintained at 1-year follow-up, with a mean (SD) pain score of 1.51(1.59) in the PRT group, 2.79 (1.78) in the placebo group, and 3.00 (1.77) in the usual care group. Hedges g was -0.70 for PRT vs placebo (P = .001) and -1.05 for PRT vs usual care (P < .001) at 1-year follow-up. Longitudinal fMRI showed (1) reduced responses to evoked back pain in the anterior midcingulate and the anterior prefrontal cortex for PRT vs placebo; (2) reduced responses in the anterior insula for PRT vs usual care; (3) increased resting connectivity from the anterior prefrontal cortex and the anterior insula to the primary somatosensory cortex for PRT vs both control groups; and (4) increased connectivity from the anterior midcingulate to the precuneus for PRT vs usual care. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Psychological treatment centered on changing patients' beliefs about the causes and threat value of pain may provide substantial and durable pain relief for people with CBP.",,,,,,,,10.1001/jamapsychiany.2021.2669,http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiany.2021.2669,SEP 2021,34586357,WOS:000702496900003,View Full Record in Web of Science

METHODS In this ongoing, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 clinical trial, we investigated the safety, vaccine efficacy, and immunogenicity of two doses of AZD1222 as compared with placebo in preventing the onset of symptomatic and severe coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) 15 days or more after the second dose in adults, including older adults, in the United States, Chile, and Peru. RESULTS A total of 32,451 participants underwent randomization, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive AZD1222 (21,635 participants) or placebo (10,816 participants). AZD1222 was safe, with low incidences of serious and medically attended adverse events and adverse events of special interest; the incidences were similar to those observed in the placebo group. Solicited local and systemic reactions were generally mild or moderate in both groups. Overall estimated vaccine efficacy was 74.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 65.3 to 80.5; P<0.001) and estimated vaccine efficacy was 83.5% (95% CI, 54.2 to 94.1) in participants 65 years of age or older. High vaccine efficacy was consistent across a range of demographic subgroups. In the fully vaccinated analysis subgroup, no severe or critical symptomatic Covid-19 cases were observed among the 17,662 participants in the AZD1222 group; 8 cases were noted among the 8550 participants in the placebo group (<0.1%). The estimated vaccine efficacy for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection (nucleocapsid antibody sero-conversion) was 64.3% (95% CI, 56.1 to 71.0; P<0.001).

This allows for the precise targeting of immune responses against pathogens and also ensures self-tolerance, the ability of the host to protect self tissues from immune damage. One way to maintain self-tolerance is to evolve a self signal and suppress any immune response directed at tissues that carry this signal. Here, we characterize the Drosophila tuSz1 mutant strain, which mounts an aberrant immune response against its own fat body. We demonstrate that this autoimmunity is the result of two mutations: 1) a mutation in the GCS1 gene that disrupts N-glycosylation of extracellular matrix proteins covering the fat body, and 2) a mutation in the Drosophila Janus Kinase ortholog that causes precocious activation of hemocytes. Our data indicate that N-glycans attached to extracellular matrix proteins serve as a self signal and that activated hemocytes attack tissues lacking this signal. The simplicity of this invertebrate self-recognition system and the ubiquity of its constituent parts suggests it may have functional homologs across animals.",SEP 28,2021,118,39,,,e2017460118,10.1073/pnas.2017460118|1of12,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2017460118|1of12,,34544850,WOS:000704004200019,View Full Record in Web of Science

These enzymes ligate an amino acid to a cognate tRNA and have proofreading and editing capabilities that ensure high fidelity. Phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS) preferentially ligates a phenylalanine to a tRNA(Phe) over the chemically similar tyrosine, which differs from phenylalanine by a single hydroxyl group. In bacteria that undergo exposure to oxidative stress such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, tyrosine isomer levels increase due to phenylalanine oxidation. Several residues are oxidized in PheRS and contribute to hyperactive editing, including against mischarged Tyr-tRNA(Phe), despite these oxidized residues not being directly implicated in PheRS activity. Here, we solve a 3.6 A cryo-electron microscopy structure of oxidized S. Typhimurium PheRS. We find that oxidation results in widespread structural rearrangements in the beta-subunit editing domain and enlargement of its editing domain. Oxidization also enlarges the phenylalanyladenylate binding pocket but to a lesser extent. Together, these changes likely explain why oxidation leads to hyperaccurate editing and decreased misincorporation of tyrosine. Taken together, these results help increase our understanding of the survival of S.

The analysis was conducted on data collected from the Intensive care units (ICU) at Emory Healthcare, Atlanta, GA and University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN and the Cerner (R) Health Facts Deidentified Database, a multi-site COVID-19 EMR database. The participants in the analysis consisted of adults over 18 years of age. Clinical data from 35,804 patients who developed ARDS and controls were used to generate predictive models that identify risk for ARDS onset up to 12-hours before satisfying the Berlin criteria. We identified salient features from the electronic medical record that predicted respiratory failure among this population. The machine learning algorithm which provided the best performance exhibited AUROC of 0.89 (95% CI = 0.88-0.90), sensitivity of 0.77 (95% CI = 0.75-0.78), specificity 0.85 (95% CI = 085-0.86). Validation performance across two separate health systems (comprising 899 COVID-19 patients) exhibited AUROC of 0.82 (0.81-0.83) and 0.89 (0.87, 0.90). Important features for prediction of ARDS included minimum oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), standard deviation of the systolic blood pressure (SBP), O-2 flow, and maximum respiratory rate over an observational window of 16-hours. Analyzing the performance of the model across various cohorts indicates that the model performed best among a younger age group (18-40) (AUROC = 0.93 [0.92-0.94]), compared to an older age group (80+) (AUROC = 0.81 [0.81-0.82]). The model performance was comparable on both male and female groups, but performed significantly better on the severe ARDS group compared to the mild and moderate groups.

This study explores whole brain functional network connectivity from fMRI data during jazz music improvisation compared against a baseline of prelearned score performance. Given that creativity might be affected by external execution, another dimension where musicians imagine or vocalize the music was also tested. We found improvisation was associated with a state of weak connectivity necessary for attenuated executive control network recruitment associated with a feeling of flow allowing unhindered musical creation.

Data showing a proven overall survival benefit with a systemic treatment are lacking. Tebentafusp is a bispecific protein consisting of an affinity-enhanced T-cell receptor fused to an anti-CD3 effector that can redirect T cells to target glycoprotein 100-positive cells. Methods In this open-label, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned previously untreated HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with metastatic uveal melanoma in a 2:1 ratio to receive tebentafusp (tebentafusp group) or the investigator's choice of therapy with single-agent pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, or dacarbazine (control group), stratified according to the lactate dehydrogenase level. The primary end point was overall survival. Results A total of 378 patients were randomly assigned to either the tebentafusp group (252 patients) or the control group (126 patients). Overall survival at 1 year was 73% in the tebentafusp group and 59% in the control group (hazard ratio for death, 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37 to 0.71; P<0.001) in the intention-to-treat population. Progression-free survival was also significantly higher in the tebentafusp group than in the control group (31% vs. 19% at 6 months; hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.94; P=0.01). The most common treatment-related adverse events in the tebentafusp group were cytokine-mediated events (due to T-cell activation) and skin-related events (due to glycoprotein 100-positive melanocytes), including rash (83%), pyrexia (76%), and pruritus (69%). These adverse events decreased in incidence and severity after the first three or four doses and infrequently led to discontinuation of the trial treatment (2%). No treatment-related deaths were reported. Conclusions Treatment with tebentafusp resulted in longer overall survival than the control therapy among previously untreated patients with metastatic uveal melanoma.

Vaccine efficacy in preventing Covid-19 illness was 93.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 91.0 to 94.8), with 55 confirmed cases in the mRNA-1273 group (9.6 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 7.2 to 12.5) and 744 in the placebo group (136.6 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 127.0 to 146.8). The efficacy in preventing severe disease was 98.2% (95% CI, 92.8 to 99.6), with 2 cases in the mitNA-1273 group and 106 in the placebo group, and the efficacy in preventing asymptomatic infection starting 14 days after the second injection was 63.0% (95% CI, 56.6 to 68.5), with 214 cases in the mRNA-1273 group and 498 in the placebo group. Vaccine efficacy was consistent across ethnic and racial groups, age groups, and participants with coexisting conditions. No safety concerns were identified. CONCLUSIONS The mRNA-1273 vaccine continued to be efficacious in preventing Covid-19 illness and severe disease at more than 5 months, with an acceptable safety profile, and protection against asymptomatic infection was observed.",NOV 4,2021,385,19,1774,1785,,10.1056/NEJMoa2113017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2113017,SEP 2021,34551225,WOS:000697804800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

METHODS We conducted a test-negative case-control study involving health care personnel across 25 U.S. states. Cases were defined on the basis of a positive polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) or antigen-based test for SARS-CoV-2 and at least one Covid-19-like symptom. Controls were defined on the basis of a negative PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, regardless of symptoms, and were matched to cases according to the week of the test date and site. Using conditional logistic regression with adjustment for age, race and ethnic group, underlying conditions, and exposures to persons with Covid-19, we estimated vaccine effectiveness for partial vaccination (assessed 14 days after receipt of the first dose through 6 days after receipt of the second dose) and complete vaccination (assessed >= 7 days after receipt of the second dose). RESULTS The study included 1482 case participants and 3449 control participants. Vaccine effectiveness for partial vaccination was 77.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 70.9 to 82.7) with the BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) and 88.9% (95% CI, 78.7 to 94.2) with the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna); for complete vaccination, vaccine effectiveness was 88.8% (95% CI, 84.6 to 91.8) and 96.3% (95% CI, 91.3 to 98.4), respectively. Vaccine effectiveness was similar in subgroups defined according to age (<50 years or >= 50 years), race and ethnic group, presence of underlying conditions, and level of patient contact. Estimates of vaccine effectiveness were lower during weeks 9 through 14 than during weeks 3 through 8 after receipt of the second dose, but confidence intervals overlapped widely. CONCLUSIONS The BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines were highly effective under real-world conditions in preventing symptomatic Covid-19 in health care personnel, including those at risk for severe Covid-19 and those in racial and ethnic groups that have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic.",DEC 16,2021,385,25,,,e90,10.1056/NEJMoa2106599,http://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2106599,SEP 2021,34551224,WOS:000697804900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We recently reported that tyrosine phosphorylation activates IDH1 R132H mutant in AML cells. Here, we show that mutant IDH2 (mIDH2) R140Q commonly has K413 acetylation, which negatively regulates mIDH2 activity in human AML cells by attenuating dimerization and blocking binding of substrate (a-ketoglutarate) and cofactor (NADPH). Mechanistically, K413 acetylation of mitochondrial mIDH2 is achieved through a series of hierarchical phosphorylation events mediated by tyrosine kinase FLT3, which phosphorylates mIDH2 to recruit upstream mitochondrial acetyltransferase ACAT1 and simultaneously activates ACAT1 and inhibits upstream mitochondrial deacetylase SIRT3 through tyrosine phosphorylation. Moreover, we found that the intrinsic enzyme activity of mIDH2 is much higher than mIDH1, thus the inhibitory K413 acetylation optimizes leukemogenic ability of mIDH2 in AML cells by both producing sufficient 2-HG for transformation and avoiding cytotoxic accumulation of intracellular 2-HG.",SEP 16,2021,81,18,3833,+,,10.1016/j.molcel.2021.06.027,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2021.06.027,SEP 2021,34289383,WOS:000701842800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Objective To compare the outcomes of TAVR with a balloon-expandable valve for bicuspid vs tricuspid aortic stenosis in patients who are at low surgical risk. Design, Setting, and Participants Registry-based cohort study of patients undergoing TAVR at 684 US centers. Participants were enrolled in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS)/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapies Registry from June 2015 to October 2020. Among 159 661 patients (7058 bicuspid, 152 603 tricuspid), 37 660 patients (3243 bicuspid and 34 417 tricuspid) who were at low surgical risk (defined as STS risk score <3%) were included in the analysis. Exposures TAVR for bicuspid vs tricuspid aortic stenosis. Main Outcomes and Measures Coprimary outcomes were 30-day and 1-year mortality and stroke. Secondary outcomes included procedural complications and valve hemodynamics. Results Among 159 661 patients (7058 bicuspid; 152 603 tricuspid), 3168 propensity-matched pairs of patients with bicuspid and tricuspid aortic stenosis at low surgical risk were analyzed (mean age, 69 years; 69.8% men; mean [SD] STS-predicted risk of mortality, 1.7% [0.6%] for bicuspid and 1.7% [0.7%] for tricuspid). There was no significant difference between the bicuspid and tricuspid groups' rates of death at 30 days (0.9% vs 0.8%; hazard ratio [HR], 1.18 [95% CI, 0.68-2.03]; P = .55) and at 1 year (4.6% vs 6.6%; HR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.55-1.02]; P = .06) or stroke at 30 days (1.4% vs 1.2%; HR, 1.14 [95% CI, 0.73-1.78]; P = .55) and at 1 year (2.0% vs 2.1%; HR 1.03 [95% CI, 0.69-1.53]; P = .89).There were no significant differences between the bicuspid and tricuspid groups in procedural complications, valve hemodynamics (aortic valve gradient: 13.2 mm Hg vs 13.5 mm Hg; absolute risk difference [RD], 0.3 mm Hg [95% CI, -0.9 to 0.3 mm Hg]), and moderate or severe paravalvular leak (3.4% vs 2.1%; absolute RD, 1.3% [95% CI, -0.6% to 3.2%]). Conclusions and Relevance In this preliminary, registry-based study of propensity-matched patients at low surgical risk who had undergone TAVR for aortic stenosis, patients treated for bicuspid vs tricuspid aortic stenosis had no significant difference in mortality or stroke at 30 days or 1 year. Because of the potential for selection bias and absence of a control group treated surgically for bicuspid aortic stenosis, randomized trials are needed to adequately assess the efficacy and safety of transcatheter aortic valve replacement for bicuspid aortic stenosis in patients at low surgical risk. This registry-based cohort study compared rates of mortality and stroke at 30 days and 1 year among patients at low surgical risk with bicuspid vs tricuspid aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Question Are there differences in mortality and stroke between patients at low surgical risk who undergo transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for bicuspid compared with tricuspid aortic stenosis? Findings In this registry-based cohort study that included 3168 propensity-matched pairs of patients at low surgical risk undergoing TAVR for bicuspid vs tricuspid aortic stenosis, there was no significant difference in death at 30 days (0.9% vs 0.8%), death at 1 year (4.6% vs 6.6%), stroke at 30 days (1.4% vs 1.2%), or stroke at 1 year (2.0% vs 2.1%). Meaning Patients at low surgical risk who underwent TAVR for bicuspid aortic stenosis compared with tricuspid aortic stenosis had no significant difference in mortality or stroke at 30 days or 1 year. Because of the potential for selection bias, randomized trials would be needed to adequately assess the efficacy and safety of TAVR for bicuspid aortic stenosis.",SEP 21,2021,326,11,1034,1044,,10.1001/jama.2021.13346,http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.2021.13346,,34546301,WOS:000702170600017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Appropriate calculations of diagnosis rates by HIV transmission category, race and ethnicity, and geography are needed to monitor progress towards reducing systematic disparities in health outcomes. We estimated the number of heterosexually active adults (HAAs) by sex and state to calculate appropriate HIV diagnosis rates and disparity measures within subnational regions. Methods The analysis included all HIV diagnoses attributed to heterosexual transmission in 2018 in the United States, in 50 states and the District of Columbia. Logistic regression models estimated the probability of past-year heterosexual activity among adults in three national health surveys, by sex, age group, race and ethnicity, education category, and marital status. Model-based probabilities were applied to estimated counts of HAAs by state, which were synthesized through meta-analysis. HIV diagnoses were overlaid to calculate racial- and ethnic-specific rates, rate differences (RDs), and rate ratios (RRs) among HAAs by sex and state. Results Nationally, HAA women have a two-fold higher HIV diagnosis rate than HAA men (rate per 100,000 HAAs, women: 6.57; men: 3.09). Compared to White non-Hispanic HAAs, Black HAAs have a 20-fold higher HIV diagnosis rate (RR, men: 21.28, women: 19.55; RD, men: 15.40, women: 31.78) and Hispanic HAAs have a 4-fold higher HIV diagnosis rate (RR, men: 4.68, RD, women: 4.15; RD, men: 2.79, RD, women: 5.39). Disparities were ubiquitous across regions, with >75% of states in each region having Black-to-White RR >= 10. Conclusion The racial and ethnic disparities across regions suggests a system-wide failure particularly with respect to preventing HIV among Black and Hispanic women. Pervasive disparities emphasize the role for coordinated federal responses such as the current Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiative.",SEP 20,2021,16,9,,,e0257583,10.1371/journal.pone.0257583,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257583,,34543322,WOS:000707078200053,View Full Record in Web of Science

Viral replication was significantly reduced in bronchoalveolar lavages and nasal swabs after SARS-CoV-2 challenge in vaccinated animals and most strongly correlated with levels of anti-S antibody and neutralizing activity. Lower antibody levels were needed for reduction of viral replication in the lower airway than in the upper airway.

We overcame this challenge by constructing an orthogonal UB transfer'' (OUT) cascade with yeast E3 Rsp5 to enable the exclusive delivery of an engineered UB (xUB) to Rsp5 and its substrate proteins. The OUT screen uncovered new Rsp5 substrates in yeast, such as Pal1 and Pal2, which are partners of endocytic protein Ede1, and chaperones Hsp70-Ssb, Hsp82, and Hsp104 that counteract protein misfolding and control self-perpetuating amyloid aggregates (prions), resembling those involved in human amyloid diseases.

The HCV envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 are responsible for the binding of the virus to the host cell, but the exact entry process remains undetermined(1). The majority of broadly neutralizing antibodies block interaction between HCV E2 and the large extracellular loop (LEL) of the cellular receptor CD81 (CD81-LEL)(2). Here we show that low pH enhances the binding of CD81-LEL to E2, and we determine the crystal structure of E2 in complex with an antigen-binding fragment (2A12) and CD81-LEL (E2-2A12-CD81-LEL); E2 in complex with 2A12 (E2-2A12); and CD81-LEL alone. After binding CD81, residues 418-422 in E2 are displaced, which allows for the extension of an internal loop consisting of residues 520-539. Docking of the E2-CD81-LEL complex onto a membrane-embedded, full-length CD81 places the residues Tyr529 and Trp531 of E2 proximal to the membrane. Liposome flotation assays show that low pH and CD81-LEL increase the interaction of E2 with membranes, whereas structure-based mutants of Tyr529, Trp531 and Ile422 in the amino terminus of E2 abolish membrane binding. These data support a model in which acidification and receptor binding result in a conformational change in E2 in preparation for membrane fusion.",OCT 21,2021,598,7881,521,+,,10.1038/s41586-021-03913-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03913-5,SEP 2021,34526719,WOS:000696175300015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Transcranial MRI-guided focused ultrasound (FUS), an emerging technology for noninvasive brain treatments, enables transient opening of the BBB through acoustic activation of circulating microbubbles. Here, we evaluate the safety and utility of transcranial microbubble-enhanced FUS (MB-FUS) for spatially targeted BBB opening in patients with infiltrating gliomas. In this Phase 0 clinical trial (NCT03322813), we conducted comparative and quantitative analyses of FUS exposures (sonications) and their effects on gliomas using MRI, histopathology, microbubble acoustic emissions (harmonic dose [HD]), and fluorescence-guided surgery metrics. Contrast-enhanced MRI and histopathology indicated safe and reproducible BBB opening in all patients. These observations occurred using a power cycling closed feedback loop controller, with the power varying by nearly an order of magnitude on average. This range underscores the need for monitoring and titrating the exposure on a patient-by-patient basis. We found a positive correlation between microbubble acoustic emissions (HD) and MR-evident BBB opening (P = 0.07) and associated interstitial changes (P < 0.01), demonstrating the unique capability to titrate the MB-FUS effects in gliomas. Importantly, we identified a 2.2-fold increase of fluorescein accumulation in MB-FUS-treated compared to untreated non-enhancing tumor tissues (P < 0.01) while accounting for vascular density. Collectively, this study demonstrates the capabilities of MB-FUS for safe, localized, controlled BBB opening and highlights the potential of this technology to improve the surgical and pharmacologic treatment of brain tumors.",SEP 14,2021,118,37,,,e2103280118,10.1073/pnas.2103280118,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2103280118,,34504017,WOS:000697000500019,View Full Record in Web of Science

With the accumulation of public scRNA-seq data, supervised cell type identification methods have gained increasing popularity due to better accuracy, robustness, and computational performance. Despite all the advantages, the performance of the supervised methods relies heavily on several key factors: feature selection, prediction method, and, most importantly, choice of the reference dataset. Results: In this work, we perform extensive real data analyses to systematically evaluate these strategies in supervised cell identification. We first benchmark nine classifiers along with six feature selection strategies and investigate the impact of reference data size and number of cell types in cell type prediction. Next, we focus on how discrepancies between reference and target datasets and how data preprocessing such as imputation and batch effect correction affect prediction performance. We also investigate the strategies of pooling and purifying reference data. Conclusions: Based on our analysis results, we provide guidelines for using supervised cell typing methods. We suggest combining all individuals from available datasets to construct the reference dataset and use multi-layer perceptron (MLP) as the classifier, along with F-test as the feature selection method.

We aimed to measure the prevalence of hypertension and progress in its detection, treatment, and control from 1990 to 2019 for 200 countries and territories. Methods We used data from 1990 to 2019 on people aged 30-79 years from population-representative studies with measurement of blood pressure and data on blood pressure treatment. We defined hypertension as having systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg or greater, diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg or greater, or taking medication for hypertension. We applied a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the prevalence of hypertension and the proportion of people with hypertension who had a previous diagnosis (detection), who were taking medication for hypertension (treatment), and whose hypertension was controlled to below 140/90 mm Hg (control). The model allowed for trends over time to be non-linear and to vary by age. Findings The number of people aged 30-79 years with hypertension doubled from 1990 to 2019, from 331 (95% credible interval 306-359) million women and 317 (292-344) million men in 1990 to 626 (584-668) million women and 652 (604-698) million men in 2019, despite stable global age-standardised prevalence. In 2019, age-standardised hypertension prevalence was lowest in Canada and Peru for both men and women; in Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and some countries in western Europe including Switzerland, Spain, and the UK for women; and in several low-income and middle-income countries such as Eritrea, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, and Solomon Islands for men. Hypertension prevalence surpassed 50% for women in two countries and men in nine countries, in central and eastern Europe, central Asia, Oceania, and Latin America. Globally, 59% (55-62) of women and 49% (46-52) of men with hypertension reported a previous diagnosis of hypertension in 2019, and 47% (43-51) of women and 38% (35-41) of men were treated. Control rates among people with hypertension in 2019 were 23% (20-27) for women and 18% (16-21) for men. In 2019, treatment and control rates were highest in South Korea, Canada, and Iceland (treatment >70%; control >50%), followed by the USA, Costa Rica, Germany, Portugal, and Taiwan. Treatment rates were less than 25% for women and less than 20% for men in Nepal, Indonesia, and some countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania. Control rates were below 10% for women and men in these countries and for men in some countries in north Africa, central and south Asia, and eastern Europe. Treatment and control rates have improved in most countries since 1990, but we found little change in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania. Improvements were largest in high-income countries, central Europe, and some upper-middle-income and recently high-income countries including Costa Rica, Taiwan, Kazakhstan, South Africa, Brazil, Chile, Turkey, and Iran. Interpretation Improvements in the detection, treatment, and control of hypertension have varied substantially across countries, with some middle-income countries now outperforming most high-income nations. The dual approach of reducing hypertension prevalence through primary prevention and enhancing its treatment and control is achievable not only in high-income countries but also in low-income and middle-income settings.

Formal government and legal structures further constrain the adaptive capacity of our SETs. However, new, selforganized forms of adaptive governance are emerging at multiple scales in natural resource-based SETs. Adaptive governance involves the private and public sectors as well as formal and informal institutions, self-organized to fill governance gaps in the traditional roles of states. While new governance forms are emerging, they are not yet doing so rapidly enough to match the pace of environmental change. Furthermore, they do not yet possess the legitimacy or capacity needed to address disparities between the winners and losers from change. These emergent forms of adaptive governance appear to be particularly effective in managing complexity. We explore governance and SETs as coevolving complex systems, focusing on legal systems to understand the potential pathways and obstacles to equitable adaptation. We explore how governments may facilitate the emergence of adaptive governance and promote legitimacy in both the process of governance despite the involvement of nonstate actors, and its adherence to democratic values of equity and justice. To manage the contextual nature of the results of change in complex systems, we propose the establishment of long-term study initiatives for the coproduction of knowledge, to accelerate learning and synergize interactions between science and governance and to foster public science and epistemic communities dedicated to navigating transitions to more just, sustainable, and resilient futures.",SEP 7,2021,118,36,,,e2102798118,10.1073/pnas.2102798118,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2102798118,,34475210,WOS:000694705600011,View Full Record in Web of Science

While proteins containing both cdi-GMP synthesizing (GGDEF) and c-di-GMP hydrolyzing (EAL) domains are widely predicted in bacterial genomes, it is poorly understood how domains with opposing enzymatic activity are regulated within a single polypeptide. Herein, we report the characterization of a globin-coupled sensor protein (GCS) from Paenibacillus dendritiformis (DcpG) with bifunctional c-di-GMP enzymatic activity. DcpG contains a regulatory sensor globin domain linked to diguanylate cyclase (GGDEF) and phosphodiesterase (EAL) domains that are differentially regulated by gas binding to the heme; GGDEF domain activity is activated by the Fe(II)-NO state of the globin domain, while EAL domain activity is activated by the Fe(II)-O2 state. The in vitro activity of DcpG is mimicked in vivo by the biofilm formation of P. dendritiformis in response to gaseous environment, with nitric oxide conditions leading to the greatest amount of biofilm formation. The ability of DcpG to differentially control GGDEF and EAL domain activity in response to ligand binding is likely due to the unusual properties of the globin domain, including rapid ligand dissociation rates and high midpoint potentials. Using structural information from small-angle X-ray scattering and negative stain electron microscopy studies, we developed a structural model of DcpG, providing information about the regulatory mechanism. These studies provide information about full-length GCS protein architecture and insight into the mechanism by which a single regulatory domain can selectively control output domains with opposing enzymatic activities.",SEP 7,2021,118,36,,,e2100657118,10.1073/pnas.2100657118,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2100657118,,34475207,WOS:000705126700020,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, whether infection leaves a lasting impact on mucosal responses remains uncertain. Here we examined the effect of the chemical irritant dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) on intestinal damage and wound healing in chronically infected mice. Our findings indicate that prior infection with T. gondii exacerbates damage to the colon caused by DSS and impairs wound healing by suppressing stem cell regeneration of the epithelium. Enhanced tissue damage was attributable to inflammatory monocytes that emerge preactivated from bone marrow, migrate to the intestine, and release inflammatory mediators, including nitric oxide. Tissue damage was reversed by neutralization of inflammatory monocytes or nitric oxide, revealing a causal mechanism for tissue damage.

Notably, this is becoming increasingly critical in preparing for public health emergencies. Methods To explore the coevolution dynamics between science and policy (SAP), this study explored the changes in, and development of, COVID-19 research in the early period of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, from 30 December 2019 to 26 June 2020. In this study, VOSviewer was adopted to calculate the link strength of items extracted from scientific publications, and machine learning clustering analysis of scientific publications was carried out to explore dynamic trends in scientific research. Trends in relevant policies that corresponded to changing trends in scientific research were then traced. Results The study observes a salient change in research content as follows: an earlier focus on children and pregnant patients, common symptoms, nucleic acid test, and non-Chinese medicine was gradually replaced with a focus on aged patients, pregnant patients, severe symptoms and asymptomatic infection, antibody assay, and Chinese medicine. Mental health is persistent throughout China's COVID-19 research. Further, our research reveals a correlation between the evolution of COVID-19 policies and the dynamic development of COVID-19 research. The average issuance time of relevant COVID-19 policies in China is 8.36 days after the launching of related research. Conclusions In the early stage of the outbreak in China, the formulation of research-driven-COVID-19 policies and related scientific research followed a similar dynamic trend, which is clearly a manifestation of a coevolution model (CEM).

The success of screening tools such as cervical cytology to reduce mortality has spurred significant interest in new methods for early detection (for example, using non-invasive blood-based or biofluid-based biomarkers). Yet biomarkers shed from early lesions are limited by fundamental biological and mass transport barriers - such as short circulation times and blood dilution - that limit early detection. To address this issue, synthetic biomarkers are being developed. These represent an emerging class of diagnostics that deploy bioengineered sensors inside the body to query early-stage tumours and amplify disease signals to levels that could potentially exceed those of shed biomarkers. These strategies leverage design principles and advances from chemistry, synthetic biology and cell engineering. In this Review, we discuss the rationale for development of biofluid-based synthetic biomarkers. We examine how these strategies harness dysregulated features of tumours to amplify detection signals, use tumour-selective activation to increase specificity and leverage natural processing of bodily fluids (for example, blood, urine and proximal fluids) for easy detection. Finally, we highlight the challenges that exist for preclinical development and clinical translation of synthetic biomarker diagnostics. Synthetic biomarkers are an emerging class of diagnostics that amplify disease signals for sensitive and specific detection of early-stage cancers. This Review discusses the rationale and design of biofluid-based synthetic biomarkers as well as translational challenges and future directions.",OCT,2021,21,10,655,668,,10.1038/s41568-021-00389-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41568-021-00389-3,SEP 2021,34489588,WOS:000692949600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To date, few studies have assessed the prognostic value of PRS relative to standards of care. Schizophrenia (SCZ), the archetypal psychotic illness, is an ideal test case for this because the predictive power of the SCZ PRS exceeds that of most other common diseases. Here, we analyzed clinical and genetic data from two multi-ethnic cohorts totaling 8,541 adults with SCZ and related psychotic disorders, to assess whether the SCZ PRS improves the prediction of poor outcomes relative to clinical features captured in a standard psychiatric interview. For all outcomes investigated, the SCZ PRS did not improve the performance of predictive models, an observation that was generally robust to divergent case ascertainment strategies and the ancestral background of the study participants. The inclusion of polygenic risk scores does not improve the performance of standard-of-care predictive models of disease outcomes in patients with psychosis.",SEP,2021,27,9,1576,+,,10.1038/s41591-021-01475-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41591-021-01475-7,SEP 2021,34489608,WOS:000692960600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Unsurprisingly, CPPs have attracted attention for their potential drug delivery applications, but several technical hurdles remain to be overcome. Chief among them is the so-called 'endosomal escape problem,' i.e. the propensity of CPP-cargo molecules to be endocytosed but remain entrapped in endosomes rather than reaching the cytosol. Previously, a CPP fused to calmodulin that bound calmodulin binding site-containing cargos was shown to efficiently deliver cargos to the cytoplasm, effectively overcoming the endosomal escape problem. The CPP-adaptor, TAT-CaM, evinces delivery at nM concentrations and more rapidly than we had previously been able to measure. To better understand the kinetics and mechanism of CPP-adaptor-mediated cargo delivery, a real-time cell penetrating assay was developed in which a flow chamber containing cultured cells was installed on the stage of a confocal microscope to allow for observation ab initio. Also examined in this study was an improved CPP-adaptor that utilizes naked mole rat (Heterocephalus glaber) calmodulin in place of human and results in superior internalization, likely due to its lesser net negative charge. Adaptor-cargo complexes were delivered into the flow chamber and fluorescence intensity in the midpoint of baby hamster kidney cells was measured as a function of time. Delivery of 400 nM cargo was observed within seven minutes and fluorescence continued to increase linearly as a function of time. Cargo-only control experiments showed that the minimal uptake which occurred independently of the CPP-adaptor resulted in punctate localization consistent with endosomal entrapment. A distance analysis was performed for cell-penetration experiments in which CPP-adaptor-delivered cargo showing wider dispersions throughout cells as compared to an analogous covalently-bound CPP-cargo. Small molecule endocytosis inhibitors did not have significant effects upon delivery. The real-time assay is an improvement upon static endpoint assays and should be informative in a broad array of applications.",SEP 2,2021,16,9,,,e0254468,10.1371/journal.pone.0254468,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254468,,34473728,WOS:000707050100013,View Full Record in Web of Science

To understand current rates, recent trends, and potential trajectories of child mortality for the next decade, we present the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 findings for all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality in children younger than 5 years of age, with multiple scenarios for child mortality in 2030 that include the consideration of potential effects of COVID-19, and a novel framework for quantifying optimal child survival. Methods We completed all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality analyses from 204 countries and territories for detailed age groups separately, with aggregated mortality probabilities per 1000 livebirths computed for neonatal mortality rate (NMR) and under-5 mortality rate (USMR). Scenarios for 2030 represent different potential trajectories, notably including potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the potential impact of improvements preferentially targeting neonatal survival. Optimal child survival metrics were developed by age, sex, and cause of death across all GBD location-years. The first metric is a global optimum and is based on the lowest observed mortality, and the second is a survival potential frontier that is based on stochastic frontier analysis of observed mortality and Healthcare Access and Quality Index. Findings Global U5MR decreased from 71.2 deaths per 1000 livebirths (95% uncertainty interval WI] 68.3-74-0) in 2000 to 37.1 (33.2-41.7) in 2019 while global NMR correspondingly declined more slowly from 28.0 deaths per 1000 live births (26.8-29-5) in 2000 to 17.9 (16.3-19-8) in 2019. In 2019,136 (67%) of 204 countries had a USMR at or below the SDG 3.2 threshold and 133 (65%) had an NMR at or below the SDG 3.2 threshold, and the reference scenario suggests that by 2030,154 (75%) of all countries could meet the U5MR targets, and 139 (68%) could meet the NMR targets. Deaths of children younger than 5 years totalled 9.65 million (95% UI 9.05-10.30) in 2000 and 5.05 million (4.27-6.02) in 2019, with the neonatal fraction of these deaths increasing from 39% (3.76 million [95% UI 3.53-4.021) in 2000 to 48% (2.42 million; 2.06-2.86) in 2019. NMR and U5MR were generally higher in males than in females, although there was no statistically significant difference at the global level. Neonatal disorders remained the leading cause of death in children younger than 5 years in 2019, followed by lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, congenital birth defects, and malaria. The global optimum analysis suggests NMR could be reduced to as low as 0.80 (95% UI 0.71-0.86) deaths per 1000 livebirths and U5MR to 1.44 (95% UI 1-27-1.58) deaths per 1000 livebirths, and in 2019, there were as many as 1.87 million (95% UI 1-35-2.58; 37% [95% UI 32-43]) of 5.05 million more deaths of children younger than 5 years than the survival potential frontier. Interpretation Global child mortality declined by almost half between 2000 and 2019, but progress remains slower in neonates and 65 (32%) of 204 countries, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, are not on track to meet either SDG 3.2 target by 2030. Focused improvements in perinatal and newborn care, continued and expanded delivery of essential interventions such as vaccination and infection prevention, an enhanced focus on equity, continued focus on poverty reduction and education, and investment in strengthening health systems across the development spectrum have the potential to substantially improve USMR. Given the widespread effects of COVID-19, considerable effort will be required to maintain and accelerate progress. Copyright (C) 2021 The Author(s).

Here we studied CD8 T cells in patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive head and neck cancer and identified several epitopes derived from HPV E2, E5 and E6 proteinsthat allowed usto analyse virus-specific CD8 T cells using major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I tetramers. HPV-specific CD8 T cells expressed PD-1 and were detectable in the tumour at levelsthat ranged from 0.1% to 10% oftumour-infiltrating CD8 T lymphocytes (TILs) for a given epitope. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses of tetramer-sorted HPV-specific PD-1(+) CD8 TILs revealed three transcriptionally distinct subsets. One subset expressed TCF7and other genes associated with PD-1(+) stem-like CD8 T cellsthat are critical for maintaining T cell responses in conditions of antigen persistence. The second subset expressed more effector molecules, representing a transitory cell population, and the third subset was characterized by a terminally differentiated gene signature. T cell receptor clonotypes were shared between the three subsets and pseudotime analysis suggested a hypothetical differentiation trajectory from stem-like to transitory to terminally differentiated cells. More notably, HPV-specific PD-1(+)TCF-1(+) stem-like TILs proliferated and differentiated into more effector-like cells after in vitro stimulation with the cognate HPV peptide, whereas the more terminally differentiated cells did not proliferate. The presence of functional HPV-specific PD-1(+)TCF-1(+)CD45RO(+) stem-like CD8 T cells with proliferative capacity showsthat the cellular machinery to respond to PD-1 blockade exists in HPV-positive head and neck cancer, supporting the further investigation of PD-1 targeted therapies in this malignancy. Furthermore, HPV therapeutic vaccination efforts have focused on E6 and E7 proteins; our results suggest that E2 and E5 should also be considered for inclusion asvaccine antigensto elicit tumour-reactive CD8 T cell responses of maximal breadth.",SEP 9,2021,597,7875,279,+,,10.1038/s41586-021-03862-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03862-z,SEP 2021,34471285,WOS:000693816400005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Unfortunately, effective strategies to prevent and treat thrombosis in this patient population remain uncertain. In the setting of a worsening pandemic, there is an urgent need to provide practical guidance to the clinicians on management of the coagulopathy, while waiting for the results from large systematic trials to establish best practices. At our institution, we convened an interdisciplinary group of 25 experts in the field of thrombosis from different medical specialties to review available literature and brainstorm management strategies. The group provided a 3-tiered anticoagulation algorithm for patients with COVID-19 along with a pathway for multidisciplinary review of difficult or refractory cases, which are described in this manuscript. In these unprecedented times where medical decision making is made difficult by both the novelty of the disease and paucity of robust data, clinical algorithms such as the one presented here may prove to be helpful for frontline providers caring for individual patients.

Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for the efficient delivery of drugs need to be designed for the particular administration route and type of drug. Here we report the design of LNPs for the efficient delivery of therapeutic RNAs to the lung via nebulization. We optimized the composition, molar ratios and structure of LNPs made of lipids, neutral or cationic helper lipids and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) by evaluating the performance of LNPs belonging to six clusters occupying extremes in chemical space, and then pooling the lead clusters and expanding their diversity. We found that a low (high) molar ratio of PEG improves the performance of LNPs with neutral (cationic) helper lipids, an identified and optimal LNP for low-dose messenger RNA delivery.

Global KMC coverage is low. This study was conducted to develop and evaluate context-adapted implementation models to achieve improved coverage. Design This study used mixed-methods applying implementation science to develop an adaptable strategy to improve implementation. Formative research informed the initial model which was refined in three iterative cycles. The models included three components: (1) maximising access to KMC-implementing facilities, (2) ensuring KMC initiation and maintenance in facilities and (3) supporting continuation at home postdischarge. Participants 3804 infants of birth weight under 2000g who survived the first 3 days, were available in the study area and whose mother resided in the study area. Main outcome measures The primary outcomes were coverage of KMC during the 24 hours prior to discharge and at 7days postdischarge. Results Key barriers and solutions were identified for scaling up KMC. The resulting implementation model achieved high population-based coverage. KMC initiation reached 68%-86% of infants in Ethiopian sites and 87% in Indian sites. At discharge, KMC was provided to 68% of infants in Ethiopia and 55% in India. At 7days postdischarge, KMC was provided to 53%-65% of infants in all sites, except Oromia (38%) and Karnataka (36%). Conclusions This study shows how high coverage of KMC can be achieved using context-adapted models based on implementation science. They were supported by govemment leadership, health workers' conviction that KMC is the standard of care, women's and families' acceptance of KMC, and changes in infrastructure, policy, skills and practice.",SEP,2021,6,9,,,E005905,10.1136/1136/bmjgh-2021-005905,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/1136/bmjgh-2021-005905,,34518203,WOS:000697845300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Data was reviewed for all SRs based on reproducibility and librarian participation and further reviewed for search quality of reproducible searches. Results Librarians were co-authors in only 2.5% of the 913 included SRs and librarians were mentioned or acknowledged in only 9% of included SRs. Librarian coauthors were associated with more reproducible searches, higher search quality, and at least three databases searched. Although the results indicate librarians are associated with improved SR quality, due to the small number of SRs that included a librarian, results were not statistically significant. Conclusion Despite guidance from organizations that produce SR guidelines recommending the inclusion of a librarian or information specialist on the review team, and despite evidence showing that librarians improve the reproducibility of searches and the reporting of methodology in SRs, librarians are not being included in SRs in the field of dental medicine.

DeepHoF made up for the lack of an accurate tool, reaching a satisfactory AUC of 0.975 in the five-classification, and could make a reliable prediction for the novel viruses without close neighbors in phylogeny. Additionally, to fill the gap in the efficient inference of host species for SARS-CoV-2 using existing tools, we conducted a deep analysis on the host likelihood profile calculated by DeepHoF. Using the isolates sequenced in the earliest stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, we inferred that minks, bats, dogs and cats were potential hosts of SARS-CoV-2, while minks might be one of the most noteworthy hosts. Several genes of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated their significance in determining the host range.

Objectives We sought to determine the effects of prior exposure to HCoV Betacoronavirus HKU1 spike protein on serologic responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein after intramuscular administration in mice. We also sought to understand the baseline seroprevalence of HKU1 spike antibodies in healthy children and to measure their correlation with SARS-CoV-2 binding and neutralizing antibodies in children hospitalized with acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). Methods Groups of 5 mice were injected intramuscularly with two doses of alum-adjuvanted HKU1 spike followed by SARS-CoV-2 spike; or the reciprocal regimen of SARS-Cov-2 spike followed by HKU1 spike. Sera collected 21 days following each injection was analyzed for IgG antibodies to HKU1 spike, SARS-CoV-2 spike, and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Sera from children hospitalized with acute COVID-19, MIS-C or healthy controls (n = 14 per group) were analyzed for these same antibodies. Results Mice primed with SARS-CoV-2 spike and boosted with HKU1 spike developed high titers of SARS-CoV-2 binding and neutralizing antibodies; however, mice primed with HKU1 spike and boosted with SARS-CoV-2 spike were unable to mount neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. HKU1 spike antibodies were detected in all children with acute COVID-19, MIS-C, and healthy controls. Although children with MIS-C had significantly higher HKU1 spike titers than healthy children (GMT 37239 vs. 7551, P = 0.012), these titers correlated positively with both SARS-CoV-2 binding (r = 0.7577, P<0.001) and neutralizing (r = 0.6201, P = 0.001) antibodies. Conclusions Prior murine exposure to HKU1 spike protein completely impeded the development of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, consistent with original antigenic sin. In contrast, the presence of HKU1 spike IgG antibodies in children with acute COVID-19 or MIS-C was not associated with diminished neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2.",AUG 27,2021,16,8,,,e0256482,10.1371/journal.pone.0256482,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256482,,34449792,WOS:000752313300022,View Full Record in Web of Science

Minipigs were given captopril orally (0.96 mg/kg) twice daily for 12 days following total body irradiation (Co-60 1.79 Gy, 0.42-0.48 Gy/min). Blood was drawn over a time course following irradiation, and tissue samples were collected at euthanasia (32-35 days post-irradiation). We observed improved survival with captopril treatment, with survival rates of 62.5% in vehicle treated and 87.5% in captopril treated group. Additionally, captopril significantly improved recovery of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and a trend toward improvement in recovery of red blood cells and platelets. Captopril significantly reduced radiation-induced expression of cytokines erythropoietin and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and suppressed radiation-induced acute-phase inflammatory response cytokine serum amyloid protein A.

FXS mouse models display clinically-relevant phenotypes, such as increased anxiety and hyperactivity. Despite their availability, so far advances in drug development have not yielded new treatments. Therefore, testing novel drugs that can ameliorate FXS' cognitive and behavioral impairments is imperative. ANAVEX2-73 (blarcamesine) is a sigma-1 receptor (S1R) agonist with a strong safety record and preliminary efficacy evidence in patients with Alzheimer's disease and Rett syndrome, other synaptic neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders. S1R's role in calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial function, cellular functions related to synaptic function, makes blarcamesine a potential drug candidate for FXS. Administration of blarcamesine in 2-month-old FXS and wild type mice for 2 weeks led to normalization in two key neurobehavioral phenotypes: open field test (hyperactivity) and contextual fear conditioning (associative learning). Furthermore, there was improvement in marble-burying (anxiety, perseverative behavior). It also restored levels of BDNF, a converging point of many synaptic regulators, in the hippocampus. Positron emission tomography (PET) and ex vivo autoradiographic studies, using the highly selective S1R PET ligand [F-18]FTC-146, demonstrated the drug's dose-dependent receptor occupancy. Subsequent analyses also showed a wide but variable brain regional distribution of S1Rs, which was preserved in FXS mice. Altogether, these neurobehavioral, biochemical, and imaging data demonstrates doses that yield measurable receptor occupancy are effective for improving the synaptic and behavioral phenotype in FXS mice.

Efforts to mitigate these effects include deintensification of craniospinal irradiation (CSI) dose and volume. METHODS ACNS0331 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: ) randomly assigned patients age 3-21 years with average-risk MB to receive posterior fossa radiation therapy (PFRT) or involved field radiation therapy (IFRT) following CSI. Young children (3-7 years) were also randomly assigned to receive standard-dose CSI (SDCSI; 23.4 Gy) or low-dose CSI (LDCSI; 18 Gy). Post hoc molecular classification and mutational analysis contextualized outcomes according to known biologic subgroups (Wingless, Sonic Hedgehog, group 3, and group 4) and genetic biomarkers. Neurocognitive changes and ototoxicity were monitored over time. RESULTS Five hundred forty-nine patients were enrolled on study, of which 464 were eligible and evaluable to compare PFRT versus IFRT and 226 for SDCSI versus LDCSI. The five-year event-free survival (EFS) was 82.5% (95% CI, 77.2 to 87.8) and 80.5% (95% CI, 75.2 to 85.8) for the IFRT and PFRT regimens, respectively, and 71.4% (95% CI, 62.8 to 80) and 82.9% (95% CI, 75.6 to 90.2) for the LDCSI and SDCSI regimens, respectively. IFRT was not inferior to PFRT (hazard ratio, 0.97; 94% upper CI, 1.32). LDCSI was inferior to SDCSI (hazard ratio, 1.67%; 80% upper CI, 2.10). Improved EFS was observed in patients with Sonic Hedgehog MB who were randomly assigned to the IFRT arm (P = .018). Patients with group 4 MB receiving LDCSI exhibited inferior EFS (P = .047). Children receiving SDCSI exhibited greater late declines in IQ (estimate = 5.87; P = .021). CONCLUSION Reducing the radiation boost volume in average-risk MB is safe and does not compromise survival. Reducing CSI dose in young children with average-risk MB results in inferior outcomes, possibly in a subgroup-dependent manner, but is associated with better neurocognitive outcome. Molecularly informed patient selection warrants further exploration for children with MB to be considered for late-effect sparing approaches.

Data Sources Nationwide data from the National Health Interview Survey for 2006-2015. Study Design Generalized difference-in-difference models with state-specific time trends were used to assess the relationship between PDMPs and two outcomes: missed days of work and bedridden days. Data Collection/Extraction Methods All respondents above the age of 18 years with complete data on key measures were included. A subpopulation of respondents who had a recent surgery or injury was identified. Principal Findings We found an increase of 3.3 and 5.9 bedridden days associated with optional and must-use PDMPs, respectively, for respondents reporting a recent injury or surgery (p-values <0.05; unadjusted population average 12.2 bedridden days). Increases in days of missed work were not statistically significant. Conclusions Implementation of PDMPs was associated with negative unintended consequences in the injury/surgery subpopulation. The association between bedridden days and PDMPs suggests a gap between clinical trials showing equivalence of opioids and nonopioids for pain treatment and real-world results. As increasingly tighter opioid restrictions proliferate, evidence-based strategies to address pain without opioids in the acute pain population likely need to be more widely disseminated.",DEC,2021,56,6,1215,1221,,10.1111/1475-6773.13705,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1475-6773.13705,AUG 2021,34409600,WOS:000686116400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this randomized, controlled trial, an injectable long-acting agent, cabotegravir, was found to be superior to daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-emtricitabine in preventing incident HIV infection in cisgender men and transgender women who have sex with men. Background Safe and effective long-acting injectable agents for preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are needed to increase the options for preventing HIV infection. Methods We conducted a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, noninferiority trial to compare long-acting injectable cabotegravir (CAB-LA, an integrase strand-transfer inhibitor [INSTI]) at a dose of 600 mg, given intramuscularly every 8 weeks, with daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-emtricitabine (TDF-FTC) for the prevention of HIV infection in at-risk cisgender men who have sex with men (MSM) and in at-risk transgender women who have sex with men. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive one of the two regimens and were followed for 153 weeks. HIV testing and safety evaluations were performed. The primary end point was incident HIV infection. Results The intention-to-treat population included 4566 participants who underwent randomization; 570 (12.5%) identified as transgender women, and the median age was 26 years (interquartile range, 22 to 32). The trial was stopped early for efficacy on review of the results of the first preplanned interim end-point analysis. Among 1698 participants from the United States, 845 (49.8%) identified as Black. Incident HIV infection occurred in 52 participants: 13 in the cabotegravir group (incidence, 0.41 per 100 person-years) and 39 in the TDF-FTC group (incidence, 1.22 per 100 person-years) (hazard ratio, 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.18 to 0.62). The effect was consistent across prespecified subgroups. Injection-site reactions were reported in 81.4% of the participants in the cabotegravir group and in 31.3% of those in the TDF-FTC group. In the participants in whom HIV infection was diagnosed after exposure to CAB-LA, INSTI resistance and delays in the detection of HIV infection were noted. No safety concerns were identified. Conclusions CAB-LA was superior to daily oral TDF-FTC in preventing HIV infection among MSM and transgender women. Strategies are needed to prevent INSTI resistance in cases of CAB-LA PrEP failure.

Treating solid malignancies with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells typically results in poor responses. Immunomodulatory biologics delivered systemically can augment the cells' activity, but off-target toxicity narrows the therapeutic window. Here we show that the activity of intratumoural CAR T cells can be controlled photothermally via synthetic gene switches that trigger the expression of transgenes in response to mild temperature elevations (to 40-42 degrees C). In vitro, heating engineered primary human T cells for 15-30 min led to over 60-fold-higher expression of a reporter transgene without affecting the cells' proliferation, migration and cytotoxicity. In mice, CAR T cells photothermally heated via gold nanorods produced a transgene only within the tumours. In mouse models of adoptive transfer, the systemic delivery of CAR T cells followed by intratumoural production, under photothermal control, of an interleukin-15 superagonist or a bispecific T cell engager bearing an NKG2D receptor redirecting T cells against NKG2D ligands enhanced antitumour activity and mitigated antigen escape.

This prespecified, exploratory biomarker analysis from the ASCENT trial evaluates the association between tumor Trop-2 expression and germline BRCA1/2 mutation status with clinical outcomes. Patients and methods: Patients with mTNBC refractory to or progressing after two or more prior chemotherapies, with one or more in the metastatic setting, were randomized to receive SG (10 mg/kg intravenously days 1 and 8, every 21 days) or TPC (capecitabine, eribulin, vinorelbine, or gemcitabine) until disease progression/unacceptable toxicity. Biopsy or surgical specimens were collected at study entry to determine Trop-2 expression level using a validated immunohistochemistry assay and histochemical scoring. Germline BRCA1/2 mutation status was collected at baseline. Results: Of 468 assessable patients, 290 had Trop-2 expression data [64% (n = 151 SG) versus 60% (n = 139 TPC)] and 292 had known BRCA1/2 mutation status [63% (n = 149 SG) versus 61% (n = 143 TPC)]. Median progression-free survival in SG- versus TPC-treated patients was 6.9, 5.6, and 2.7 months versus 2.5, 2.2, and 1.6 months for high, medium, and low Trop-2 expression, respectively.

Efficacy outcomes were numerically higher with SG versus TPC in patients with and without germline BRCA1/2 mutations. Conclusions: SG benefits patients with previously treated mTNBC expressing high/medium Trop-2 compared with standard-of-care chemotherapy and regardless of germline BRCA1/2 mutation status.

The cellular response to vascular anastomosis or recanalization is, however, largely unknown and current techniques rely on restoration rather than optimization of flow into the atretic arteries. An improved understanding of cellular response post anastomosis may result in reduced restenosis. Here, an in vitro platform is used to model anastomosis in pulmonary arteries (PAs) and for procedural planning to reduce vascular restenosis. Bifurcated PAs are bioprinted within 3D hydrogel constructs to simulate a reestablished intervascular connection. The PA models are seeded with human endothelial cells and perfused at physiological flow rate to form endothelium. Particle image velocimetry and computational fluid dynamics modeling show close agreement in quantifying flow velocity and wall shear stress within the bioprinted arteries.

Our study had three objectives: 1) assess feasibility and clinical impact 2) evaluate patient/parent satisfaction and 3) estimate costs. Methods All cardiology clinic visits during a two-year study period were included. All patients received an electrocardiogram and echocardiogram performed by a local nurse in Gulu which were stored and transmitted to the Uganda Heart Institute in the capital of Kampala for remote consultation by a cardiologist. Results were relayed to patients/families following cardiologist interpretation. The following telemedicine process was utilized: 1) clinical intake by nurse in Gulu; 2) ECG and echocardiography acquisition in Gulu; 3) echocardiography transmission to the Uganda Heart Institute in Kampala, Uganda; 4) remote telemedicine consultation by cardiologists in Kampala; and 5) communication of results to patients/families in Gulu. Clinical care and technical aspects were tracked. Diagnoses and recommendations were analyzed by age groups (0-5 years, 6-21 years, 22-50 years and > 50 years). A mixed methods approach involving interviews and surveys was used to assess patient satisfaction. Healthcare sector costs of telemedicine-based cardiovascular care were estimated using time-driven activity-based costing. Results Normal studies made up 47%, 55%, 76% and 45% of 1,324 patients in the four age groups from youngest to oldest. Valvular heart disease (predominantly rheumatic heart disease) was the most common diagnosis in the older three age groups. Medications were prescribed to 31%, 31%, 24%, and 48% of patients in the four age groups. The median time for consultation was 7 days. A thematic analysis of focus group transcripts displayed an overall acceptance and appreciation for telemedicine, citing cost- and time-saving benefits. The cost of telemedicine was $29.48/visit. Conclusions Our data show that transmission and interpretation of echocardiograms from a remote clinic in northern Uganda is feasible, serves a population with a high burden of heart disease, has a significant impact on patient care, is favorably received by patients, and can be delivered at low cost. Further study is needed to better assess the impact relative to existing standards of care and cost effectiveness.",AUG 6,2021,16,8,,,e0255918,10.1371/journal.pone.0255918,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255918,,34358281,WOS:000685266400010,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Preuss, TM; Wise, SP","Preuss, Todd M.; Wise, Steven P.",,Evolution of prefrontal cortex,NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,Review,"Subdivisions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) evolved at different times. Agranular parts of the PFC emerged in early mammals, and rodents, primates, and other modern mammals share them by inheritance. These are limbic areas and include the agranular orbital cortex and agranular medial frontal cortex (areas 24, 32, and 25). Rodent research provides valuable insights into the structure, functions, and development of these shared areas, but it contributes less to parts of the PFC that are specific to primates, namely, the granular, isocortical PFC that dominates the frontal lobe in humans. The first granular PFC areas evolved either in early primates or in the last common ancestor of primates and tree shrews. Additional granular PFC areas emerged in the primate stem lineage, as represented by modern strepsirrhines. Other granular PFC areas evolved in simians, the group that includes apes, humans, and monkeys. In general, PFC accreted new areas along a roughly posterior to anterior trajectory during primate evolution. A major expansion of the granular PFC occurred in humans in concert with other association areas, with modifications of corticocortical connectivity and gene expression, although current evidence does not support the addition of a large number of new, human-specific PFC areas.",JAN,2022,47,1,3,19,,10.1038/s41386-021-01076-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41386-021-01076-5,AUG 2021,34363014,WOS:000682413700002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods We report the pivotal phase 2 results of ZUMA-3, an international, multicentre, single-arm, open-label study evaluating the efficacy and safety of the autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy KTE-X19 in adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Patients were enrolled at 25 sites in the USA, Canada, and Europe. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1, and morphological disease in the bone marrow (>5% blasts). After leukapheresis and conditioning chemotherapy, patients received a single KTE-X19 infusion (1 x 10(6) CAR T cells per kg bodyweight). The primary endpoint was the rate of overall complete remission or complete remission with incomplete haematological recovery by central assessment. Duration of remission and relapse-free survival, overall survival, minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity rate, and allo-SCT rate were assessed as secondary endpoints. Efficacy and safety analyses were done in the treated population (all patients who received a dose of KTE-X19). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02614066. Findings Between Oct 1, 2018, and Oct 9, 2019, 71 patients were enrolled and underwent leukapheresis. KTE-X19 was successfully manufactured for 65 (92%) patients and administered to 55 (77%). The median age of treated patients was 40 years (IQR 28-52). At the median follow-up of 16.4 months (13.8-19.6), 39 patients (71%; 95% CI 57-82, p<0.0001) had complete remission or complete remission with incomplete haematological recovery, with 31 (56%) patients reaching complete remission. Median duration of remission was 12.8 months (95% CI 8.7-not estimable), median relapse-free survival was 11.6 months (2.7-15.5), and median overall survival was 18.2 months (15.9-not estimable). Among responders, the median overall survival was not reached, and 38 (97%) patients had MRD negativity. Ten (18%) patients received allo-SCT consolidation after KTE-X19 infusion. The most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher were anaemia (27 [49%] patients) and pyrexia (20 [36%] patients). 14 (25%) patients had infections of grade 3 or higher. Two grade 5 KTE-X19-related events occurred (brain herniation and septic shock). Cytokine release syndrome of grade 3 or higher occurred in 13 (24%) patients and neurological events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 14 (25%) patients. Interpretation KTE-X19 showed a high rate of complete remission or complete remission with incomplete haematological recovery in adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, with the median overall survival not reached in responding patients, and a manageable safety profile. These findings indicate that KTE-X19 has the potential to confer long-term clinical benefit to these patients. Copyright (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

We hypothesized that therapeutic-dose anticoagulation may improve outcomes in noncritically ill patients who are hospitalized with Covid-19. METHODS In this open-label, adaptive, multiplatform, controlled trial, we randomly assigned patients who were hospitalized with Covid-19 and who were not critically ill (which was defined as an absence of critical care-level organ support at enrollment) to receive pragmatically defined regimens of either therapeutic-dose anticoagulation with heparin or usual-care pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis. The primary outcome was organ support-free days, evaluated on an ordinal scale that combined in-hospital death (assigned a value of -1) and the number of days free of cardiovascular or respiratory organ support up to day 21 among patients who survived to hospital discharge. This outcome was evaluated with the use of a Bayesian statistical model for all patients and according to the baseline D-dimer level. RESULTS The trial was stopped when prespecified criteria for the superiority of therapeutic-dose anticoagulation were met. Among 2219 patients in the final analysis, the probability that therapeutic-dose anticoagulation increased organ support-free days as compared with usual-care thromboprophylaxis was 98.6% (adjusted odds ratio, 1.27; 95% credible interval, 1.03 to 1.58). The adjusted absolute between-group difference in survival until hospital discharge without organ support favoring therapeutic-dose anticoagulation was 4.0 percentage points (95% credible interval, 0.5 to 7.2). The final probability of the superiority of therapeutic-dose anticoagulation over usual-care thromboprophylaxis was 97.3% in the high D-dimer cohort, 92.9% in the low D-dimer cohort, and 97.3% in the unknown D-dimer cohort. Major bleeding occurred in 1.9% of the patients receiving therapeutic-dose anticoagulation and in 0.9% of those receiving thromboprophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS In noncritically ill patients with Covid-19, an initial strategy of therapeutic-dose anticoagulation with heparin increased the probability of survival to hospital discharge with reduced use of cardiovascular or respiratory organ support as compared with usual-care thromboprophylaxis.",AUG 26,2021,385,9,790,802,,10.1056/NEJMoa2105911,http://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2105911,AUG 2021,34351721,WOS:000683386400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our replicable methodology advances the traditional additive sectoral wedge analysis of carbon abatement potential by incorporating solution interdependencies and by spanning both carbon sources and sinks. We estimate that a system of 20 solutions could cut Georgia's carbon footprint by 35% in 2030 relative to a business-as-usual forecast and by 50% relative to Georgia's emissions in 2005. We also produce a carbon abatement cost curve that aligns private and social costs as well as benefits with units of avoided CO2-e.

Perplexingly, this population disappears in obese mice, limiting the promise of Treg-based therapies for metabolic disorders. We exploited the power of a VAT-Treg TCR-transgenic mouse model to follow the dynamics of, and phenotypic changes in, the VAT-Treg population throughout the development of diet-induced obesity. Our results show that VAT-Tregs are lost under obesogenic conditions due to downregulation of their defining transcription factor, PPAR gamma, coupled with their strikingly enhanced responses to pro-inflammatory cytokines. In particular, the VAT from obese mice (and reportedly humans) was strongly enriched in plasmacytoid dendritic cells that actively express interferon-alpha. These cells were directly toxic to PPAR gamma(+) VAT-Tregs.

Implantation of the formed cardiovascular tissue into the infarcted hearts of mice led to the migration of reprogrammed cells to the injured tissue, reducing regional cardiac strain and improving cardiac function.

Recently, the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced/metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has demonstrated efficacy, including longer progression-free survival and increased overall survival in subsets of patients. Based on clinical benefit in randomized trials, ICIs in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of some patients with advanced/metastatic TNBC have been approved by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA), expanding options for patients. Ongoing questions remain, however, about the optimal chemotherapy backbone for immunotherapy, appropriate biomarker-based selection of patients for treatment, the optimal strategy for immunotherapy treatment in earlier stage disease, and potential use in histological subtypes other than TNBC. To provide guidance to the oncology community on these and other important concerns, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) convened a multidisciplinary panel of experts to develop a clinical practice guideline (CPG).

The basis for this difference is unclear. We find that mRNA and protein expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cell entry receptor for the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19, increases with advancing age in distal lung epithelial cells. However, in humans, ACE2 expression exhibits high levels of intra- and interindividual heterogeneity. Further, cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience endoplasmic reticulum stress, triggering an unfolded protein response and caspase- mediated apoptosis, a natural host defense system that halts virion production. Apoptosis of infected cells can be selectively induced by treatment with apoptosis-modulating BH3 mimetic drugs. Notably, epithelial cells within young lungs and airways are more primed to undergo apoptosis than those in adults, which may naturally hinder virion production and support milder COVID-19 severity.",AUG,2021,7,34,,,eabf8609,10.1126/sciadv.abf8609,http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abf8609,,34407940,WOS:000686461400005,View Full Record in Web of Science

We hypothesized that combining sip-T with interleukin (IL)-7, a homeostatic cytokine that enhances both B and T cell development and proliferation, would augment and prolong antigen-specific immune responses against both PA2024 (the immunogen for sip-T) and prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP). Methods Fifty-four patients with mCRPC treated with sip-T were subsequently enrolled and randomized 1:1 into observation (n=26) or IL-7 (n=28) arms of a phase II clinical trial (NCT01881867). Recombinant human (rh) IL-7 (CYT107) was given weeklyx4. Immune responses were evaluated using flow cytometry, mass cytometry (CyTOF), interferon (IFN)-gamma ELISpot, H-3-thymidine incorporation, and ELISA. Results Treatment with rhIL-7 was well tolerated. For the rhIL-7-treated, but not observation group, statistically significant lymphocyte subset expansion was found, with 2.3-2.6-fold increases in CD4+T, CD8+T, and CD56(bright) NK cells at week 6 compared with baseline. No significant differences in PA2024 or PAP-specific T cell responses measured by IFN-gamma ELISpot assay were found between rhIL-7 and observation groups. However, antigen-specific T cell proliferative responses and humoral IgG and IgG/IgM responses significantly increased over time in the rhIL-7-treated group only. CyTOF analyses revealed pleiotropic effects of rhIL-7 on lymphocyte subsets, including increases in CD137 and intracellular IL-2 and IFN-gamma expression. While not powered to detect clinical outcomes, we found that 31% of patients in the rhIL-7 group had prostate specific antigen (PSA) doubling times of >6 months, compared with 14% in the observation group. Conclusions Treatment with rhIL-7 led to a significant expansion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and CD56(bright) natural killer (NK) cells compared with observation after treatment with sip-T. The rhIL-7 treatment also led to improved antigen-specific humoral and T cell proliferative responses over time as well as to increased expression of activation markers and beneficial cytokines. This is the first study to evaluate the use of rhIL-7 after sip-T in patients with mCRPC and demonstrates encouraging results for combination approaches to augment beneficial immune responses.",AUG,2021,9,8,,,e002903,10.1136/jitc-2021-002903,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2021-002903,,34452927,WOS:000691920700008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Previous work has focused on patients with cancer and COVID-19, but little has been reported on healthcare system changes among patients without COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of patients with breast cancer (BC) in New York City between February 1, 2020, and April 30, 2020. New patients were included as were patients scheduled to receive intravenous or injectable therapy. Patients with COVID-19 were excluded. Demographic and treatment information were obtained by chart review. Delays and/or changes in systemic therapy, surgery, radiation, and radiology related to the pandemic were tracked, along with the reasons for delay and/or change. Univariate and multivariable analysis were used to identify factors associated with delay and/or change. RESULTS: We identified 350 eligible patients, of whom 149 (42.6%) experienced a delay and/or change, and practice reduction (51.0%) was the most common reason. The patients who identified as Black or African American, Asian, or Other races were more likely to experience a delay and/or change compared with White patients (Black, 44.4%; Asian, 47.1%; Other, 55.6%; White, 31.4%; P = .001). In multivariable analysis, Medicaid compared with commercial insurance (odds ratio [OR], 3.04; 95% CI, 1.32 to 7.27) was associated with increased odds of a delay and/or change, whereas stage II or III BC compared with stage I (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.95; and OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.092, respectively) was associated with decreased odds of a delay and/or change.

OBJECTIVE To examine associations of discriminatory experiences with brainwide response to threat-relevant cues in trauma-exposed US Black women as they engage in an attentionally demanding task. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A cross-sectional study was conducted from May 1, 2014, to July 1, 2019, among 55 trauma-exposed US Black women to examine associations of racial discrimination experiences with patterns of neural response and behavior to trauma-relevant images in an affective attentional control task. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and trauma exposure were entered as covariates to isolate variance associated with experiences of racial discrimination. EXPOSURES Varying levels of trauma, PTSD symptoms, and experiences of racial discrimination. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Experiences of Discrimination Questionnaire (EOD) (range, 0-9) for count of the number of situations for which each participant reported having unfair treatment for a racial reason. Experiences of trauma and PTSD symptoms were assessed with the Traumatic Events Inventory (TEI) (number of times the person was exposed to trauma; score range, 0-112) and PTSD Symptom Scale (PSS) (score range, 0-51). Response to trauma-relevant vs neutral distractor cues were assessed via functional magnetic resonance imaging during performance of an affective Stroop (attentional control) task. Statistical analyses were conducted at a whole-brain, voxelwise level with familywise error correction. RESULTS In this study of 55 Black women in the US (mean [SD] age, 37.7 [10.7] years; range, 21-61 years), participants reported a mean (SD) TEI frequency of 33.0 (18.8) and showed moderate levels of current PTSD symptoms (mean [SD] PSS score, 15.4 [12.9]). Mean (SD) EOD scores were 2.35 (2.44) and were moderately correlated with current PTSD symptoms (PSS total: r = 0.36; P=.009) but not with age (r = 0.20; P =.15) or TEI frequency (r = -0.02; P =.89). During attention to trauma-relevant vs neutral images, more experiences of racial discrimination were associated with significantly greater response in nodes of emotion regulation and fear inhibition (ventromedial prefrontal cortex) and visual attention (middle occipital cortex) networks, even after accounting for trauma and severity of PTSD symptoms (brainwide familywise error corrected; r = 0.33 for ventromedial prefrontal cortex; P =.02). Racial discrimination was also associated with affective Stroop task performance; errors on trials with threat-relevant stimuli were negatively correlated with experiences of racial discrimination (r = -0.41; P =.003). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings suggest that experiences of racial discrimination associate with disproportionately greater response in brain regions associated with emotion regulation and fear inhibition and visual attention. Frequent racism experienced by Black individuals may potentiate attentional and regulatory responses to trauma-relevant stressors and lead to heightened modulation of regulatory resources. This may represent an important neurobiological pathway for race-related health disparities.",SEP,2021,78,9,1005,1012,,10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2021.1480,http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2021.1480,JUL 2021,34319369,WOS:000679479100005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Distinct GR DNA-binding sequences with activating or repressive activities have been identified, but how they modulate transcription in opposite ways is not known. We show that GR forms phase-separated condensates that specifically concentrate known coregulators via their intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in vitro. A combination of dynamic, multivalent (between IDRs) and specific, stable interactions (between LxxLL motifs and the GR ligand-binding domain) control the degree of recruitment. Importantly, GR DNA binding directs the selective partitioning of coregulators within GR condensates such that activating DNAs cause enhanced recruitment of coactivators. Our work shows that condensation controls GR function by modulating coregulator recruitment and provides a mechanism for the up-and down-regulation of GR target genes controlled by distinct DNA recognition elements.",JUL 27,2021,118,30,,,e2024685118,10.1073/pnas.2024685118,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2024685118,,34285072,WOS:000685039700009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Single-cell ATAC-seq analysis revealed an epigenomically distinct subcluster of monocytes with reduced chromatin accessibility at AP-1-targeted loci after vaccination. Similar effects were observed in response to vaccination with the AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 pandemic influenza vaccine.

Genomes from more primitive organisms are more abundant in CpG sites that, through the process of methylation, deamination and subsequent mutation to thymine-phosphate-guanine (TpG) sites, can produce new transcription factor binding sites. Here, we examined the evolutionary history of the over 36 000 glucocorticoid receptor (GR) consensus binding motifs in the human genome and identified a subset of them in regulatory regions that arose via a deamination and subsequent mutation event. GR can bind to both unmodified and methylated pre-GR binding sequences (GBSs) that contain a CpG site. Our structural analyses show that CpG methylation in a pre-GBS generates a favorable interaction with Arg447 mimicking that made with a TpG in a GBS. This methyl-specific recognition arose 420 million years ago and was conserved during the evolution of GR and likely helps fix the methylation on the relevant cytosines.

Results revealed that teachers' ratings of parent engagement were consistently lower among families experiencing adverse SDOH and/or whose children were chronically absent; however, there was no significant relationship between teachers' ratings of parent engagement and child health problems. Additionally, chronic absence partially mediated the relationship between three SDOH indicators (total material hardships, parent education level, and child health problems) and teacher-rated parent engagement.

We will also assess the efficacy of the intervention in reducing the frequency of behavioural symptoms of dementia as well as family Care Partner reactivity to the symptoms. Design This is a multi-component, quasi-experimental study that focuses on facilitating effective management of behavioural symptoms that occur in the later stages of dementia. Methods Family Care Partners (n = 124) for persons with Alzheimer's disease will participate in two 8-week videoconferencing components that address behavioural symptoms-in both the persons with Alzheimer's disease and their Care Partners. In the first component ('Nova'), Care Partners work with one nurse for an hour/week for 4 weeks, then they join a small group for another 4 weeks. In the second component ('Constellation'), Care Partners work in a larger group to hone skills and knit supportive relationships. Behavioural symptom frequency and Care Partner reactivity to the behaviours will be measured prior to, during and after the intervention. The study is funded by the United States National Institute on Aging (R01AG067546); funding was initiated as on February, 2021. Discussion Tele-STELLA fills a gap in current videoconference-based psychoeducational interventions in that it offers real-time interaction with nurses and peers. The intervention was designed with feedback by pilot participants. This study will assess Tele-STELLA in its current, novel format; thus, preparing it for a larger, future randomized controlled trial. Impact Tele-STELLA addresses symptoms that occur in the later stages of dementia, providing families with tools to facilitate effective behavioural management. Because Tele-STELLA is implemented via videoconferencing, it targets Care Partners who face barriers to support, such as cost and transportation.

Methods In this cross-sectional study, we pooled individual-level data from nationally representative surveys across 57 LMICs. We identified all countries in which a WHO Stepwise Approach to Surveillance (STEPS) survey had been done during a year in which the country fell into an eligible World Bank income group category. For LMICs that did not have a STEPS survey, did not have valid contact information, or declined our request for data, we did a systematic search for survey datasets. Eligible surveys were done during or after 2008; had individual-level data; were done in a low-income, lower-middle-income, or upper-middle-income country; were nationally representative; had a response rate of 50% or higher; contained a diabetes biomarker (either a blood glucose measurement or glycated haemoglobin [HbA(1c)]); and contained data on height and weight. Diabetes was defined biologically as a fasting plasma glucose concentration of 7.0 mmol/L (126.0 mg/dL) or higher; a random plasma glucose concentration of 11.1 mmol/L (200.0 mg/dL) or higher; or a HbA(1c) of 6.5% (48.0 mmol/mol) or higher, or by self-reported use of diabetes medication. We included individuals aged 25 years or older with complete data on diabetes status, BMI (defined as normal [18.5-22.9 kg/m(2)], upper-normal [23.0-24.9 kg/m(2)], overweight [25.0-29.9 kg/m(2)], or obese [>= 30.0 kg/m(2)]), sex, and age. Countries were categorised into six geographical regions: Latin America and the Caribbean, Europe and central Asia, east, south, and southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, Middle East and north Africa, and Oceania. We estimated the association between BMI and diabetes risk by multivariable Poisson regression and receiver operating curve analyses, stratified by sex and geographical region. Findings Our pooled dataset from 58 nationally representative surveys in 57 LMICs included 685 616 individuals. The overall prevalence of overweight was 27.2% (95% CI 26.6-27.8), of obesity was 21.0% (19.6-22.5), and of diabetes was 9. 3% (8.4-10.2). In the pooled analysis, a higher risk of diabetes was observed at a BMI of 23 kg/m(2) or higher, with a 43% greater risk of diabetes for men and a 41% greater risk for women compared with a BMI of 18.5-22.9 kg/m(2). Diabetes risk also increased steeply in individuals aged 35-44 years and in men aged 25-34 years in sub-Saharan Africa. In the stratified analyses, there was considerable regional variability in this association. Optimal BMI thresholds for diabetes screening ranged from 23.8 kg/m(2) among men in east, south, and southeast Asia to 28.3 kg/m(2) among women in the Middle East and north Africa and in Latin America and the Caribbean. Interpretation The association between BMI and diabetes risk in LMICs is subject to substantial regional variability. Diabetes risk is greater at lower BMI thresholds and at younger ages than reflected in currently used BMI cutoffs for assessing diabetes risk. These findings offer an important insight to inform context-specific diabetes screening guidelines. Copyright (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

We examined correlations between hemoglobin devices and reference hemoglobin, device accuracy (average bias, Bland-Altman plots, clinical performance) and classification bias (sensitivity, specificity) among 299 refugees (10mo-65y) in Atlanta, GA. Semi-structured interviews (n = 19) with participants and staff assessed usability and acceptability. Mean reference hemoglobin was 13.7 g/dL (SD:1.8) with 12.5% anemia. Noninvasive hemoglobin devices were not well correlated with reference hemoglobin (Apple (R) R-2 = 0.08, Android (R) R-2 = 0.11, Masimo Pronto (R) R-2 = 0.29), but stronger correlations were reported with HemoCue (R) Hb-301 (R-2 = 0.87) and Hb-801 (R-2 = 0.88). Bias (SD) varied across each device: Apple (R): -1.6 g/dL (2.0), Android (R): -0.7 g/dL (2.0), Masimo Pronto (R): -0.4 g/dL (1.6), HemoCue (R) Hb-301: +0.4 g/dL (0.7) and HemoCue (R) Hb-801: +0.2 g/dL (0.6).

Large studies with diverse populations evaluating statin use and outcomes in COVID-19 are lacking. Methods and results We used data from 10,541 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 through September 2020 at 104 US hospitals enrolled in the American Heart Association's COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Registry to evaluate the associations between statin use and outcomes. Prior to admission, 42% of subjects (n = 4,449) used statins (7% on statins alone, 35% on statins plus anti-hypertensives). Death (or discharge to hospice) occurred in 2,212 subjects (21%). Outpatient use of statins, either alone or with anti-hypertensives, was associated with a reduced risk of death (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.59, 95% CI 0.50-0.69), adjusting for demographic characteristics, insurance status, hospital site, and concurrent medications by logistic regression. In propensity-matched analyses, use of statins and/or anti-hypertensives was associated with a reduced risk of death among those with a history of CVD and/or hypertension (aOR 0.68, 95% CI 0.58-0.81). An observed 16% reduction in odds of death among those without CVD and/or hypertension was not statistically significant. Conclusions Patients taking statins prior to hospitalization for COVID-19 had substantially lower odds of death, primarily among individuals with a history of CVD and/or hypertension.

Some evidence suggests that misfolded protein aggregates found in AD brains may have originated from the gut, but the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is not fully understood. C/EBP beta/delta-secretase signaling in the colon was investigated in a 3xTg AD mouse model in an age-dependent manner. We applied chronic administration of 1% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to trigger gut leakage or colonic injection of A beta or Tau fibrils or AD patient brain lysates in 3xTg mice and combined it with excision/cutting of the gut-brain connecting vagus nerve (vagotomy), in order to explore the role of the gut-brain axis in the development of AD-like pathologies and to monitor C/EBP beta/delta-secretase signaling under those conditions. We found that C/EBP beta/delta-secretase signaling is temporally activated in the gut of AD patients and 3xTg mice, initiating formation of A beta and Tau fibrils that spread to the brain. DSS treatment promotes gut leakage and facilitates AD-like pathologies in both the gut and the brain of 3xTg mice in a C/EBP beta/delta-secretase-dependent manner. Vagotomy selectively blunts this signaling, attenuates A beta and Tau pathologies, and restores learning and memory.

Our research previously revealed that nighttime agitation might be a manifestation of restless legs syndrome (RLS). The current study aims to describe the characteristics of older adults with AD-D, nighttime agitation, and RLS, and to evaluate sleep disturbance and iron status in relation to nighttime agitation severity. Design: An observational study with baseline descriptive and correlational data from a clinical trial. Setting and Participants: Long-term care (n = 69) and independent living (n = 7); age 82.91 +/- 9.46 years, with AD-D, nighttime agitation, and RLS. Measurements: Trained observers counted nighttime agitation behaviors. Independent variables were age; cognition measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination; minutes slept from actigraphy; trans-ferrin saturation percentage (TS%) and transferrin from fasting blood samples; and illness severity using the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics. Bivariate and multivariable linear regression models were generated. Results: In the multivariable model, sleep minutes (P = .002) and TS% (P = .003) were negatively asso-ciated with frequency of nighttime agitation behaviors, and they explained 20% of the variance. Seventy-nine percent received 1 or more medications that worsen RLS symptoms, such as antihistamines and serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Conclusions and Implications: We encourage clinicians to consider nighttime agitation as a manifestation of RLS. Treatment of iron deficiency indicated by low TS% and deprescribing medications that exacerbate RLS may decrease nighttime agitation, improve sleep, and enhance quality of life in older adults with AD-D.

One component to maintain homeostasis at the mucosal surfaces is immunoglobulin A (IgA), the most abundant immunoglobulin in mammals(1,2). Several studies have revealed important characteristics of poly-reactive IgA(3,4), which is produced naturally without commensal bacteria. Considering the dynamic changes within the gut environment, however, it remains uncertain how the commensal-reactive IgA pool is shaped and how such IgA affects the microbial community. Here we show that acetate-one of the major gut microbial metabolites-not only increases the production of IgA in the colon, but also alters the capacity of the IgA pool to bind to specific microorganisms including Enterobacterales. Induction of commensal-reactive IgA and changes in the IgA repertoire by acetate were observed in mice monocolonized with Escherichia coli, which belongs to Enterobacterales, but not with the major commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, which suggests that acetate directs selective IgA binding to certain microorganisms. Mechanistically, acetate orchestrated the interactions between epithelial and immune cells, induced microbially stimulated CD4 T cells to support T-cell-dependent IgA production and, as a consequence, altered the localization of these bacteria within the colon. Collectively, we identified a role for gut microbial metabolites in the regulation of differential IgA production to maintain mucosal homeostasis.",JUL 22,2021,595,7868,560,+,,10.1038/s41586-021-03727-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03727-5,JUL 2021,34262176,WOS:000673440100004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The primary workhorse used in data dimensionality reduction and feature extraction has been the matrix singular value decomposition (SVD), which presupposes that data have been arranged in matrix format. A primary goal in this study is to show that high-dimensional datasets are more compressible when treated as tensors (i.e., multiway arrays) and compressed via tensor-SVDs under the tensor-tensor product constructs and its generalizations. We begin by proving Eckart-Young optimality results for families of tensor-SVDs under two different truncation strategies. Since such optimality properties can be proven in both matrix and tensor-based algebras, a fundamental question arises: Does the tensor construct subsume the matrix construct in terms of representation efficiency? The answer is positive, as proven by showing that a tensor-tensor representation of an equal dimensional spanning space can be superior to its matrix counterpart. We then use these optimality results to investigate how the compressed representation provided by the truncated tensor SVD is related both theoretically and empirically to its two closest tensor based analogs, the truncated high-order SVD and the truncated tensor-train SVD.",JUL 13,2021,118,28,,,e2015851118,10.1073/pnas.2015851118,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2015851118,,34234014,WOS:000685036200005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet, how mRNA vaccines stimulate the immune system to elicit protective immune responses is unknown. Here we used a systems vaccinology approach to comprehensively profile the innate and adaptive immune responses of 56 healthy volunteers who were vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2). Vaccination resulted in the robust production of neutralizing antibodies against the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (derived from 2019-nCOV/USA_WA1/2020) and, to a lesser extent, the B.1.351 strain, as well as significant increases in antigen-specific polyfunctional CD4 and CD8 T cells after the second dose. Booster vaccination stimulated a notably enhanced innate immune response as compared to primary vaccination, evidenced by (1) a greater frequency of CD14(+)CD16(+) inflammatory monocytes; (2) a higher concentration of plasma IFN gamma; and (3) a transcriptional signature of innate antiviral immunity. Consistent with these observations, our single-cell transcriptomics analysis demonstrated an approximately 100-fold increase in the frequency of a myeloid cell cluster enriched in interferon-response transcription factors and reduced in AP-1 transcription factors, after secondary immunization. Finally, we identified distinct innate pathways associated with CD8 T cell and neutralizing antibody responses, and show that a monocyte-related signature correlates with the neutralizing antibody response against the B.1.351 variant. Collectively, these data provide insights into the immune responses induced by mRNA vaccination and demonstrate its capacity to prime the innate immune system to mount a more potent response after booster immunization.",AUG 19,2021,596,7872,410,+,,10.1038/s41586-021-03791-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03791-x,JUL 2021,34252919,WOS:000681277800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

METHODS Assessing 2,996 5-year HL survivors in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study diagnosed from 1970 to 1999, we examined the cumulative incidence of severe to fatal chronic conditions (grades 3-5) using self-report conditions, medically confirmed subsequent malignant neoplasms, and cause of death based on the National Death Index. We used multivariable regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) per decade and by key treatment exposures. RESULTS HL survivors were of a mean age of 35.6 years (range, 12-58 years). The cumulative incidence of any grade 3-5 condition by 35 years of age was 31.4% (95% CI, 29.2 to 33.5). Females were twice as likely (HR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.8 to 2.4) to have a grade 3-5 condition compared with males. From the 1970s to the 1990s, there was a 20% reduction (HR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7 to 0.9) in decade-specific risk of a grade 3-5 condition (P trend = .002). In survivors who had a recurrence and/or hematopoietic cell transplant, the risk of a grade 3-5 condition was substantially elevated, similar to that of survivors treated with high-dose, extended-field radiotherapy (HR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.9 to 1.5). Compared with survivors treated with chest radiotherapy >= 35 Gy in combination with an anthracycline or alkylator, a contemporary regimen for low-intermediate risk HL was estimated to lead to a 40% reduction in risk of a grade 3-5 condition (HR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4 to 0.8).

While school-level factors are a recognized influence on bullying victimization, the elements of a 'girl-friendly' school that may reduce the risk of bullying victimization among girls and prevent dropout is understudied in lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study used baseline data from the evaluation of the Room-to-Read (RtR) Girls' Education Program (GEP) in Nepal to assess the relationship of a conceptually grounded gender-equitable school (GES) index with girls' risk of direct and relational bullying victimization, adjusted for potential confounders at the individual and school levels. Methods The school sample included all 24 RtR GEP schools and 25 community schools attended by girls in a comparison cohort, representing 729 grade six girls with complete outcome data. We employed multilevel negative binomial regression to assess the relationship between the GES score (higher scores indicate greater support for girls), and girls' risk of peer victimization, controlling for individual- and school-level covariates. Results On average, girls reported 2.84 direct victimizations and 0.27 relational victimizations in the prior week. The first component of the GES index, a generalized measure of school-level support for girls, showed a significant negative relationship with weekly relational bullying victimization in models with all school- and individual-level covariates. In the full model, a one-point higher score on the generalized GES component accounted for a 26% lower risk of relational bullying victimization in the prior week. Conclusion School-level policies, practices, and pedagogy designed to support girls may reduce their exposure to relational aggression, a form of bullying that girls most often perpetrate. In LMICs, the school may be an ideal place to raise awareness about the types and effects of peer bullying and to promote prosocial bystander behavior.

Because of the known risk of Ebola virus persistence in ocular fluid and the need to provide vision-restorative, safe cataract surgery, the Ebola Virus Persistence in Ocular Tissues and Fluids (EVICT) Study was implemented in Sierra Leone. During implementation of this multi-national study, challenges included regulatory approvals, mobilization, community engagement, infection prevention and control, and collaboration between multiple disciplines. In this report, we address the multifacted approach to address these challenges and the impact of implementation science research to address an urgent clinical subspecialty need in an outbreak setting. Methodology/Principal findings Given the patient care need to develop a protocol to evaluate ocular fluid for Ebola virus RNA persistence prior to cataract surgery, as well as protocols to provide reassurance to ophthalmologists caring for EVD survivors with cataracts, the EVICT study was designed and implemented through the work of the Ministry of Health, Sierra Leone National Eye Programme, and international partnerships. The EVICT study showed that all 50 patients who underwent ocular fluid sampling at 19 and 34 months, respectively, tested negative for Ebola virus RNA. Thirty-four patients underwent successful cataract surgery with visual acuity improvement. Here we describe the methodology for study implementation, challenges encountered, and key issues that impacted EVD vision care in the immediate aftermath of the EVD outbreak. Key aspects of the EVICT study included defining the pertinent questions and clinical need, partnership alignment with key stakeholders, community engagement with EVD survivor associations, in-country and international regulatory approvals, study site design for infection prevention and control, and thorough plans for EVD survivor follow-up care and monitoring. Challenges encountered included patient mobilization owing to transportation routes and distance of patients in rural districts. Strong in-country partnerships and multiple international organizations overcame these challenges so that lessons learned could be applied for future EVD outbreaks in West and Central Africa including EVD outbreaks that are ongoing in Guinea and Democratic Republic of Congo. Conclusions/Significance The EVICT Study showed that cataract surgery with a protocol-driven approach was safe and vision-restorative for EVD survivors, which provided guidance for EVD ophthalmic surgical care. Ophthalmologic care remains a key aspect of the public health response for EVD outbreaks but requires a meticulous, yet partnered approach with international and local in-country partners. Future efforts may build on this framework for clinical care and to improve our understanding of ophthalmic sequelae, develop treatment paradigms for EVD survivors, and strengthen vision health systems in resource-limited settings.",JUL 9,2021,16,7,,,e0252905,10.1371/journal.pone.0252905,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252905,,34242218,WOS:000674301400065,View Full Record in Web of Science

To study infection in intact mammals, mice are often used as essential genetic models. Due to humane concerns, there is a constant unmet demand to develop studies that reduce the number of mice utilized while generating objective data. Here, we describe an integrated method of evaluating lung inflammation in mice infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or murine gammaherpesvirus (MHV)-68. This method conserves animal resources while permitting evaluation of disease mechanisms in both infection settings. Lungs from a single euthanized mouse were used for two purposes-biological assays to determine inflammation and infection load, as well as histology to evaluate tissue architecture. For this concurrent assessment of multiple parameters from a single euthanized mouse, we limit in-situ formalin fixation to the right lung of the cadaver. The unfixed left lung is collected immediately and divided into several segments for biological assays including determination of pathogen titer, assessment of infection-driven cytokine levels and appearance of cell death markers. In situ fixed right lung was then processed for histological determination of tissue injury and confirmation of infection-driven cell death patterns.

Crystal structures show that the short cellular SMs stabilized a triad of surface residues to remain flush with CD1a, but the longer lipids forced the phosphocholine group to ride above the display platform to hinder TCR approach. Whereas nearly all models emphasize antigen-mediated T cell activation, we propose that the CD1a system has intrinsic autoreactivity and is negatively regulated by natural endogenous inhibitors selectively bound in its cleft. Further, the detailed chemical structures of natural blockers could guide future design of therapeutic blockers of CD1a response.",JUL 5,2021,218,7,,,e20202699,10.1084/jem.20202699,http://dx.doi.org/10.1084/jem.20202699,,33961028,WOS:000663429700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, CRCs typically report elevated anxiety and burnout and many oncology centers have high levels of coordinator attrition. To address the need for a team-based intervention to reduce burnout and promote resilience and cohesion among CRCs, we developed a compassion-centered, team-based intervention, Compassion-Centered Spiritual Health Team Intervention (CCSH-TI). METHODS: Participants were CRCs working in disease-specific teams within a comprehensive cancer center. CRCs were randomly assigned by team to either participate in four 60-minute sessions of CCSH-TI or receive the intervention after the study. To evaluate whether CCSH-TI is feasible and acceptable, we used a mixed-method approach including self-report questionnaires and a focus group. To evaluate the impact of CCSH-TI, we assessed self-reported resilience, well-being, burnout, and team civility before and immediately after the intervention period (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04060901). RESULTS: Attendance varied by team, but all teams had rates more than 60%. Coordinators rated high levels of credibility of CCSH-TI to improve burnout, and the majority reported that they received benefits, particularly in resilience and stress management, indicating acceptability. Coordinators randomly assigned to CCSH-TI reported an increase in resilience compared with coordinators randomly assigned to the wait-list group (F(41) = 4.53, P = .039). CONCLUSION: Data from this pilot study indicate that CCSH-TI may be a feasible, credible, acceptable, and effective intervention to augment individual resilience among CRCs. However, the quantitative and qualitative data suggest that more comprehensive and systematic programming is necessary to truly mitigate burnout.

Depletion of Alk5 abrogates shear stress-induced EndMT responses, and genetic targeting of endothelial Shc reduces EndMT and atherosclerosis in areas of disturbed flow.

We aimed to evaluate the global, regional, and national mortality burden associated with non-optimal ambient temperatures. Methods In this modelling study, we collected time-series data on mortality and ambient temperatures from 750 locations in 43 countries and five meta-predictors at a grid size of 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees across the globe. A three-stage analysis strategy was used. First, the temperature-mortality association was fitted for each location by use of a time-series regression. Second, a multivariate meta-regression model was built between location-specific estimates and meta-predictors. Finally, the grid-specific temperature-mortality association between 2000 and 2019 was predicted by use of the fitted metaregression and the grid-specific meta-predictors. Excess deaths due to non-optimal temperatures, the ratio between annual excess deaths and all deaths of a year (the excess death ratio), and the death rate per 100 000 residents were then calculated for each grid across the world. Grids were divided according to regional groupings of the UN Statistics Division. Findings Globally, 5 083 173 deaths (95% empirical CI [eCI] 4 087 967-5 965 520) were associated with non-optimal temperatures per year, accounting for 9.43% (95% eCI 7.58-11.07) of all deaths (8.52% [6.19-10.47] were coldrelated and 0.91% [0.56-1.36] were heat-related). There were 74 temperature-related excess deaths per 100 000 residents (95% eCI 60-87). The mortality burden varied geographically. Of all excess deaths, 2 617 322 (51.49%) occurred in Asia. Eastern Europe had the highest heat-related excess death rate and Sub-Saharan Africa had the highest cold-related excess death rate. From 2000-03 to 2016-19, the global cold-related excess death ratio changed by -0.51 percentage points (95% eCI -0.61 to -0.42) and the global heat-related excess death ratio increased by 0.21 percentage points (0.13-0.31), leading to a net reduction in the overall ratio. The largest decline in overall excess death ratio occurred in South-eastern Asia, whereas excess death ratio fluctuated in Southern Asia and Europe. Interpretation Non-optimal temperatures are associated with a substantial mortality burden, which varies spatiotemporally. Our findings will benefit international, national, and local communities in developing preparedness and prevention strategies to reduce weather-related impacts immediately and under climate change scenarios.

Here, we aimed to identify trajectory-based biomarkers using blood transcriptomes collected in the immediate aftermath of trauma exposure. Participants were recruited from an Emergency Department in the immediate aftermath of trauma exposure and assessed for PTSD symptoms at baseline, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Three empirical symptom trajectories (chronic-PTSD, remitting, and resilient) were identified in 377 individuals based on longitudinal symptoms across four data points (1, 3, 6, and 12 months), using latent growth mixture modeling. Blood transcriptomes were examined for association with longitudinal symptom trajectories, followed by expression quantitative trait locus analysis.

While a line of prior in vitro observations suggested that DUOX1 works in partnership with an airway peroxidase, lactoperoxidase (LPO), to produce antimicrobial hypothiocyanite (OSCN-) in the airways, the in vivo role of DUOX1 in mammalian organisms has remained unproven to date. Here, we show that Duox1 promotes antiviral innate immunity in vivo. Upon influenza airway challenge, Duox1-/- mice have enhanced mortality, morbidity, and impaired lung viral clearance. Duox1 increases the airway levels of several cytokines (IL-1n, IL-2, CCL1, CCL3, CCL11, CCL19, CCL20, CCL27, CXCL5, and CXCL11), contributes to innate immune cell recruitment, and affects epithelial apoptosis in the airways. In primary human tracheobronchial epithelial cells, OSCN- is generated by LPO using DUOX1-derived H2O2 and inactivates several influenza strains in vitro. We also show that OSCN- diminishes influenza replication and viral RNA synthesis in infected host cells that is inhibited by the H2O2 scavenger catalase. Binding of the influenza virus to host cells and viral entry are both reduced by OSCN- in an H2O2-dependent manner in vitro. OSCN- does not affect the neuraminidase activity or morphology of the influenza virus. Overall, this antiviral function of Duox1 identifies an in vivo role of this gene, defines the steps in the infection cycle targeted by OSCN-, and proposes that boosting this mechanism in vivo can have therapeutic potential in treating viral infections.",JUN 29,2021,118,26,,,e2017130118,10.1073/pnas.2017130118,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2017130118,,34168077,WOS:000669493300009,View Full Record in Web of Science

While most studies of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning have examined randomized species losses, trait-based filtering associated with species-specific vulnerability to drivers of diversity loss can strongly influence how ecosystem functioning responds to declining biodiversity. Moreover, the responses of ecosystem functioning to diversity loss may be mediated by environmental variability interacting with the suite of traits remaining in depauperate communities. We do not yet understand how communities resulting from realistic diversity losses (filtered by response traits) influence ecosystem functioning (via effect traits of the remaining community), especially under variable environmental conditions. Here, we directly test how realistic and randomized plant diversity losses influence productivity and invasion resistance across multiple years in a California grassland. Compared with communities based on randomized diversity losses, communities resulting from realistic (drought-driven) species losses had higher invasion resistance under climatic conditions that matched the trait-based filtering they experienced. However, productivity declined more with realistic than with randomized species losses across all years, regardless of climatic conditions. Functional response traits aligned with effect traits for productivity but not for invasion resistance. Our findings illustrate that the effects of biodiversity losses depend not only on the identities of lost species but also on how the traits of remaining species interact with varying environmental conditions. Understanding the consequences of biodiversity change requires studies that evaluate trait-mediated effects of species losses and incorporate the increasingly variable climatic conditions that future communities are expected to experience.",JUN 29,2021,118,26,,,e2022757118,10.1073/pnas.2022757118,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2022757118,,34162704,WOS:000669491700022,View Full Record in Web of Science

Adventitious lung sounds including crackles, wheezes, rhonchi, bronchial breath sounds, stridor or pleural rub and abnormal breathing patterns function as essential clinical biomarkers for the early identification, accurate diagnosis and monitoring of pulmonary disorders. Here, we present a wearable sensor module comprising of a hermetically encapsulated, high precision accelerometer contact microphone (ACM) which enables both episodic and longitudinal assessment of lung sounds, breathing patterns and respiratory rates using a single integrated sensor. This enhanced ACM sensor leverages a nano-gap transduction mechanism to achieve high sensitivity to weak high frequency vibrations occurring on the surface of the skin due to underlying lung pathologies. The performance of the ACM sensor was compared to recordings from a state-of-art digital stethoscope, and the efficacy of the developed system is demonstrated by conducting an exploratory research study aimed at recording pathological mechano-acoustic signals from hospitalized patients with a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, pneumonia, and acute decompensated heart failure. This unobtrusive wearable system can enable both episodic and longitudinal evaluation of lung sounds that allow for the early detection and/or ongoing monitoring of pulmonary disease.",JUN 28,2021,11,1,,,13427,10.1038/s41598-021-92666-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-92666-2,,34183695,WOS:000669978600018,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, such models often emphasize multiplexing capability at the expense of physiologic relevance. Particularly, the distal lung's air-blood barrier is typically modeled with epithelial cell monoculture, neglecting the substantial contribution of endothelial cell feedback in the coordination of barrier function. An obstacle to establishing high-throughput coculture models relevant to the epithelium/endothelium interface is the requirement for underside cell seeding, which is difficult to miniaturize and automate. Therefore, this paper describes a scalable, low-cost seeding method that eliminates inversion by optimizing medium density to float cells so they attach under the membrane. This method generates a 96-well model of the distal lung epithelium-endothelium barrier with serum-free, glucocorticoid-free air-liquid differentiation. The polarized epithelial-endothelial coculture exhibits mature barrier function, appropriate intercellular junction staining, and epithelial-to-endothelial transmission of inflammatory stimuli such as polyinosine:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)). Further, exposure to influenza A virus PR8 and human beta-coronavirus OC43 initiates a dose-dependent inflammatory response that propagates from the epithelium to endothelium. While this model focuses on the air-blood barrier, the underside seeding method is generalizable to various coculture tissue models for scalable, physiologic screening.",AUG,2021,10,15,,,2100879,10.1002/adhm.202100879,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adhm.202100879,JUN 2021,34174173,WOS:000666598500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The authors demonstrate a capacity for high throughput single-cell protein secretion analysis and isolation based on heterofunctional particles combined with fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). The workflow shows that antibody secreting cells (ASCs) specific for the H1 protein from influenza virus can be isolated from B cells. The workflow consists of incubating anti-CD27 particles with the ASCs, capturing locally secreted immunoglobulins with Protein G on the particles, and identifying immunoglobulins specific to H1 via fluorescent labeled antigens followed by FACS to enrich antigen-specific ASCs. Two particles designs, Janus and mixed, are tested with hybridoma cells. Mixed particles are found to improve antibody collection, while Janus particles are found to bind target cells more effectively.

The role of arginine in COVID-19 is unknown, but could contribute to cellular damage if low. Our objective was to determine arginine bioavailability in adults and children with COVID-19 vs. healthy controls. We hypothesized that arginine bioavailability would be low in patients with COVID-19 and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). We conducted a prospective observational study of three patient cohorts; arginine bioavailability was determined in asymptomatic healthy controls, adults hospitalized with COVID-19, and hospitalized children/adolescents <21 y old with COVID-19, MIS-C, or asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection identified on admission screen. Mean patient plasma amino acids were compared to controls using the Student's t test. Arginine-to-ornithine ratio, a biomarker of arginase activity, and global arginine bioavailability ratio (GABR, arginine/[ornithine+citrulline]) were assessed in all three groups. A total of 80 patients were included (28 controls, 32 adults with COVID-19, and 20 pediatric patients with COVID-19/MISC). Mean plasma arginine and arginine bioavailability ratios were lower among adult and pediatric patients with COVID-19/MIS-C compared to controls. There was no difference between arginine bioavailability in children with COVID-19 vs. MIS-C. Adults and children with COVID-19 and MIS-C in our cohort had low arginine bioavailability compared to healthy adult controls. This may contribute to immune dysregulation and endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19. Low arginine-to-ornithine ratio in patients with COVID-19 or MIS-C suggests an elevation of arginase activity.

Life and/or environmental events, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), high-fat diet (HFD), and chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH), are proposed exogenous risk factors for AD. BDNF/TrkB, an essential neurotrophic signaling for synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival, are reduced in the aged brain and in AD patients. Here, we show that environmental factors activate C/EBP beta, an inflammatory transcription factor, which subsequently up-regulates delta-secretase that simultaneously cleaves both APP and Tau, triggering AD neuropathological changes. These adverse effects are additively exacerbated in BDNF+/- or TrkB(+/-) mice. Strikingly, TBI provokes both senile plaque deposit and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) formation in TrkB(+/-) mice, associated with augmented neuroinflammation and extensive neuronal loss, leading to cognitive deficits. Depletion of C/EBP beta inhibits TBI-induced AD-like pathologies in these mice. Remarkably, amyloid aggregates and NFT are tempospatially distributed in TrkB(+/-) mice brains after TBI, providing insight into their spreading in the progression of AD-like pathologies. Hence, our study revealed the roles of exogenous (TBI, HFD, and CCH) and endogenous (TrkB/BDNF) risk factors in the onset of AD-associated pathologies.",JUN 22,2021,118,25,,,e2100986118,10.1073/pnas.2100986118,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2100986118,,34140411,WOS:000672806300014,View Full Record in Web of Science

METHODS A systematic review of the literature collected evidence regarding dosing of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapies in obese adults with cancer. PubMed and the Cochrane Library were searched for randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, or cohort studies published from November 1, 2010, through March 27, 2020. ASCO convened an Expert Panel to review the evidence and formulate recommendations. RESULTS Sixty studies, primarily retrospective, were included in the review. Overall, the evidence supported previous findings that obese adult patients tolerate full, body-size-based dosing of chemotherapy as well as nonobese patients. Fewer studies have addressed the dosing of targeted therapies and immunotherapies in relation to safety and efficacy in obese patients. RECOMMENDATIONS The Panel continues to recommend that full, weight-based cytotoxic chemotherapy doses be used to treat obese adults with cancer. New to this version of the guideline, the Panel also recommends that full, approved doses of immunotherapy and targeted therapies be offered to obese adults with cancer. In the event of toxicity, the consensus of the Panel is that dose modifications of systemic antineoplastic therapies should be handled similarly for obese and nonobese patients. Important areas for future research include the impact of sarcopenia and other measures of body composition on optimal antineoplastic dosing, and more customized dosing based on pharmacokinetic or pharmacogenetic factors.

Timely and comprehensive estimates of the prevalence of smoking tobacco use and attributable disease burden are needed to guide tobacco control efforts nationally and globally. Methods We estimated the prevalence of smoking tobacco use and attributable disease burden for 204 countries and territories, by age and sex, from 1990 to 2019 as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study. We modelled multiple smoking-related indicators from 3625 nationally representative surveys. We completed systematic reviews and did Bayesian meta-regressions for 36 causally linked health outcomes to estimate non-linear dose-response risk curves for current and former smokers. We used a direct estimation approach to estimate attributable burden, providing more comprehensive estimates of the health effects of smoking than previously available. Findings Globally in 2019, 1.14 billion (95% uncertainty interval 1.13-1.16) individuals were current smokers, who consumed 7.41 trillion (7.11-7.74) cigarette-equivalents of tobacco in 2019. Although prevalence of smoking had decreased significantly since 1990 among both males (27.5% [26. 5-28.5] reduction) and females (37.7% [35.4-39.9] reduction) aged 15 years and older, population growth has led to a significant increase in the total number of smokers from 0.99 billion (0.98-1.00) in 1990. Globally in 2019, smoking tobacco use accounted for 7.69 million (7.16-8.20) deaths and 200 million (185-214) disability-adjusted life-years, and was the leading risk factor for death among males (20.2% [19.3-21.1] of male deaths). 6.68 million [86.9%] of 7.69 million deaths attributable to smoking tobacco use were among current smokers. Interpretation In the absence of intervention, the annual toll of 7.69 million deaths and 200 million disability-adjusted life-years attributable to smoking will increase over the coming decades. Substantial progress in reducing the prevalence of smoking tobacco use has been observed in countries from all regions and at all stages of development, but a large implementation gap remains for tobacco control. Countries have a dear and urgent opportunity to pass strong, evidence-based policies to accelerate reductions in the prevalence of smoking and reap massive health benefits for their citizens.

Realistic artery geometries have been obtained for a set of four patients from intravascular ultrasound and angiography images. The numerical model computes unsteady three-dimensional blood hemodynamics and leukocyte concentration in the blood. Wall-shear stress dependent leukocyte adhesion is also computed through agent-based modeling rules, fully coupled to the hemodynamics and leukocyte transport. Numerical results have a good correlation with clinical data. Regions where high adhesion is predicted by the simulations coincide to a good approximation with artery segments presenting plaque increase, as documented by clinical data from baseline and six-month follow-up exam of the same artery. In addition, it is observed that the artery geometry and, in particular, the tortuosity of the centerline are a primary factor in determining the spatial distribution of wall-shear stress, and of the resulting leukocyte adhesion patterns. Although further work is required to overcome the limitations of the present model and ultimately quantify plaque growth in the simulations, these results are encouraging towards establishing a predictive methodology for atherosclerosis progress.",JUN 16,2021,11,1,,,12680,10.1038/s41598-021-92084-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-92084-4,,34135399,WOS:000665145500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Background The assessment of real-world effectiveness of immunomodulatory medications for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) may guide therapy. Methods We analyzed surveillance data on inpatients younger than 21 years of age who had MIS-C and were admitted to 1 of 58 U.S. hospitals between March 15 and October 31, 2020. The effectiveness of initial immunomodulatory therapy (day 0, indicating the first day any such therapy for MIS-C was given) with intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) plus glucocorticoids, as compared with IVIG alone, was evaluated with propensity-score matching and inverse probability weighting, with adjustment for baseline MIS-C severity and demographic characteristics. The primary outcome was cardiovascular dysfunction (a composite of left ventricular dysfunction or shock resulting in the use of vasopressors) on or after day 2. Secondary outcomes included the components of the primary outcome, the receipt of adjunctive treatment (glucocorticoids in patients not already receiving glucocorticoids on day 0, a biologic, or a second dose of IVIG) on or after day 1, and persistent or recurrent fever on or after day 2. Results A total of 518 patients with MIS-C (median age, 8.7 years) received at least one immunomodulatory therapy; 75% had been previously healthy, and 9 died. In the propensity-score-matched analysis, initial treatment with IVIG plus glucocorticoids (103 patients) was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular dysfunction on or after day 2 than IVIG alone (103 patients) (17% vs. 31%; risk ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.34 to 0.94). The risks of the components of the composite outcome were also lower among those who received IVIG plus glucocorticoids: left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 8% and 17% of the patients, respectively (risk ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.19 to 1.15), and shock resulting in vasopressor use in 13% and 24% (risk ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.29 to 1.00). The use of adjunctive therapy was lower among patients who received IVIG plus glucocorticoids than among those who received IVIG alone (34% vs. 70%; risk ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.65), but the risk of fever was unaffected (31% and 40%, respectively; risk ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.53 to 1.13). The inverse-probability-weighted analysis confirmed the results of the propensity-score-matched analysis. Conclusions Among children and adolescents with MIS-C, initial treatment with IVIG plus glucocorticoids was associated with a lower risk of new or persistent cardiovascular dysfunction than IVIG alone.

Tipifarnib is a farnesyltransferase inhibitor that disrupts HRAS function. We evaluated the efficacy of tipifarnib in patients with R/M mHRAS HNSCC. METHODS We enrolled 30 patients with R/M HNSCC in a single-arm, open-label phase II trial of tipifarnib for mHRAS malignancies; one additional patient was treated on an expanded access program. After an ad hoc analysis of the first 16 patients with HNSCC with mHRAS variant allele frequency (VAF) data, enrollment was limited to those with a mHRAS VAF of >= 20% (high VAF). The primary end point was objective response rate. Secondary end points included assessing safety and tolerability. Patients received tipifarnib 600 or 900 mg orally twice daily on days 1-7 and 15-21 of 28-day cycles. RESULTS Of the 22 patients with HNSCC with high VAF, 20 were evaluable for response at the time of data cutoff. Objective response rate for evaluable patients with high-VAF HNSCC was 55% (95% CI, 31.5 to 76.9). Median progression-free survival on tipifarnib was 5.6 months (95% CI, 3.6 to 16.4) versus 3.6 months (95% CI, 1.3 to 5.2) on last prior therapy. Median overall survival was 15.4 months (95% CI, 7.0 to 29.7). The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events among the 30 patients with HNSCC were anemia (37%) and lymphopenia (13%). CONCLUSION Tipifarnib demonstrated encouraging efficacy in patients with R/M HNSCC with HRAS mutations for whom limited therapeutic options exist.

Repurposing and innovation of genes are further observed within an exodermis regulatory network and illustrate its function. Comparative translatome analyses of rice, tomato, and Arabidopsis cell populations suggest increased expression conservation of root meristems compared with other homologous populations. In addition, the functions of constitutively expressed genes are more conserved than those of cell type/tissue-enriched genes.

There are no approved agents for AGVHD prevention, underscoring the critical unmet need for novel therapeutics. ABA2 was a phase II trial to rigorously assess safety, efficacy, and immunologic effects of adding T-cell costimulation blockade with abatacept to calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)/methotrexate (MTX)-based GVHD prophylaxis, to test whether abatacept could decrease AGVHD. METHODS ABA2 enrolled adults and children with hematologic malignancies under two strata: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled stratum (8/8-HLA-matched URD), comparing CNI/MTX plus abatacept with CNI/MTX plus placebo, and a single-arm stratum (7/8-HLA-mismatched URD) comparing CNI/MTX plus abatacept versus CNI/MTX CIBMTR controls. The primary end point was day +100 grade 3-4 AGVHD, with day +180 severe-AGVHD-free-survival (SGFS) a key secondary end point. Sample sizes were calculated using a higher type-1 error (0.2) as recommended for phase II trials, and were based on predicting that abatacept would reduce grade 3-4 AGVHD from 20% to 10% (8/8s) and 30% to 10% (7/8s). ABA2 enrolled 142 recipients (8/8s, median follow-up = 716 days) and 43 recipients (7/8s, median follow-up = 708 days). RESULTS In 8/8s, grade 3-4 AGVHD was 6.8% (abatacept) versus 14.8% (placebo) (P = .13, hazard ratio = 0.45). SGFS was 93.2% (CNI/MTX plus abatacept) versus 82% (CNI/MTX plus placebo, P = .05). In the smaller 7/8 cohort, grade 3-4 AGVHD was 2.3% (CNI/MTX plus abatacept, intention-to-treat population), which compared favorably with a nonrandomized matched cohort of CNI/MTX (30.2%, P < .001), and the SGFS was better (97.7% v 58.7%, P < .001). Immunologic analysis revealed control of T-cell activation in abatacept-treated patients. CONCLUSION Adding abatacept to URD HCT was safe, reduced AGVHD, and improved SGFS. These results suggest that abatacept may substantially improve AGVHD-related transplant outcomes, with a particularly beneficial impact on HLA-mismatched HCT.",JUN 10,2021,39,17,1865,+,,10.1200/JCO.20.01086,http://dx.doi.org/10.1200/JCO.20.01086,,33449816,WOS:000708082400005,View Full Record in Web of Science

High-resolution intracoronary imaging has the potential to enable the geometrically accurate three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of coronary stents. The aim of this work was to present a novel algorithm for 3D stent reconstruction of coronary artery stents based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) and angiography, and test experimentally its accuracy, reproducibility, clinical feasibility, and ability to perform computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies. Our method has the following steps: 3D lumen reconstruction based on OCT and angiography, stent strut segmentation in OCT images, packaging, rotation and straightening of the segmented struts, planar unrolling of the segmented struts, planar stent wireframe reconstruction, rolling back of the planar stent wireframe to the 3D reconstructed lumen, and final stent volume reconstruction. We tested the accuracy and reproducibility of our method in stented patient-specific silicone models using micro-computed tomography (mu CT) and stereoscopy as references. The clinical feasibility and CFD studies were performed in clinically stented coronary bifurcations. The experimental and clinical studies showed that our algorithm (1) can reproduce the complex spatial stent configuration with high precision and reproducibility, (2) is feasible in 3D reconstructing stents deployed in bifurcations, and (3) enables CFD studies to assess the local hemodynamic environment within the stent. Notably, the high accuracy of our algorithm was consistent across different stent designs and diameters. Our method coupled with patient-specific CFD studies can lay the ground for optimization of stenting procedures, patient-specific computational stenting simulations, and research and development of new stent scaffolds and stenting techniques.",JUN 10,2021,11,1,,,12252,10.1038/s41598-021-91458-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-91458-y,,34112841,WOS:000663785600002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Population trends for these RFs have varied in recent decades. Consequently, the risk factor profile for patients presenting with a new diagnosis of CAD in contemporary practice remains unknown. Objectives To examine the prevalence of RFs and their temporal trends among patients without a history of myocardial infarction or revascularization who underwent their first percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Methods We examined the prevalence and temporal trends of RFs among patients without a history of prior myocardial infarction, PCI, or coronary artery bypass graft surgery who underwent PCI at 47 non-federal hospitals in Michigan between 1/1/2010 and 3/31/2018. Results Of 69,571 men and 38,930 women in the study cohort, 95.5% of patients had 1 or more RFs and nearly half (55.2% of women and 48.7% of men) had >= 3 RFs. The gap in the mean age at the time of presentation between men and women narrowed as the number of RFs increased with a gap of 6 years among those with 2 RFs to <1 year among those with 5 RFs. Compared with patients without a current/recent history of smoking, those with a current/recent history of smoking presented a decade earlier (age 56.8 versus 66.9 years; p <0.0001).

Further, lumping stillbirth and early neonatal death into a single category of perinatal mortality may obscure different causes and thus different avenues of screening and prevention. The common marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus), a litter-bearing nonhuman primate, is an ideal species in which to study the independent effects of a mother's early life and adult phenotypes on pregnancy outcomes. We tested two hypotheses in 59 marmoset pregnancies at the Southwest National Primate Research Center and the Barshop Institute for Longevity and Aging Studies. We explored 1) whether pregnancy outcomes were predicted independently by maternal adult weight versus maternal litter size and birth weight, and 2) whether stillbirth and early neonatal death were differentially predicted by maternal variables. No maternal characteristics predicted stillbirth and no maternal adult characteristics predicted early neonatal death. In univariate Poisson models, triplet-born females had a significantly increased rate of early neonatal death (IRR[se] = 3.00[1.29], p = 0.011), while higher birth weight females had a decreased rate (IRR[se] = 0.89[0.05], p = 0.039). In multivariate Poisson models, maternal litter size remained an independent predictor, explaining 13% of the variance in early neonatal death. We found that the later in the first week those neonates died, the more weight they lost. Together these findings suggest that triplet-born and low birth weight females have distinct developmental trajectories underlying greater rates of infant loss, losses that we suggest may be attributable to developmental disruption of infant feeding and carrying. Our findings of early life contributions to adult pregnancy outcomes in the common marmoset disrupt mother-blaming narratives of pregnancy outcomes in humans. These narratives hold that the pregnant person is solely responsible for pregnancy outcomes and the health of their children, independent of socioecological factors, a moralistic framing that has shaped clinical pregnancy management. It is necessary to differentiate temporal trajectories and causes of perinatal loss and view them as embedded in external processes to develop screening, diagnostic, and treatment tools that consider the full arc of a mother's lived experience, from womb to womb and beyond.",JUN 9,2021,16,6,,,e0252093,10.1371/journal.pone.0252093,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252093,,34106943,WOS:000664642200028,View Full Record in Web of Science

Left bundle branch pacing and His bundle pacing are novel interventions that imitate the natural conduction of the heart with, theoretically, less interventricular dyssynchrony. One of the surrogate markers of interventricular synchrony is QRS duration. Our study aimed to compare the change of QRS duration before and after implantation between types of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs): left bundle branch pacing versus His bundle pacing versus biventricular pacing and conventional right ventricular pacing. A literature search for studies that reported an interval change of QRS duration after CIED implantation was conducted utilizing the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases. All relevant works from database inception through November 2020 were included in this analysis. A random-effects model, Bayesian network meta-analysis was used to analyze QRS duration changes (eg, electrical cardiac synchronization) across different CIED implantations. The mean study sample size, from 14 included studies, was 185 subjects. The search found 707 articles. After exclusions, 14 articles remained with 2,054 patients. The His bundle pacing intervention resulted in the most dramatic decline in QRS duration (mean difference,-53 ms; 95% CI-67,-39), followed by left bundle branch pacing (mean difference,-46 ms; 95% CI-60,-33), and biventricular pacing (mean difference,-19 ms; 95% CI-37,-1.8), when compared to conventional right ventricle apical pacing. When compared between LBBP and HBP, showed no statistically significant wider QRS duration in LBBP with mean different 6.5 ms. (95% CI -6.7, 21). Our network meta-analysis found that physiologic pacing has the greatest effect on QRS duration after implantation. Thus, HBP and LBBP showed no significant difference between QRS duration after implantation.

We find that the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) of pangolin CoVs binds to hACE2 as efficiently as the SARS-CoV-2 RBD in vitro. Furthermore, incorporation of pangolin CoV RBDs allows entry of pseudotyped VSV particles into hACE2-expressing cells. A screen for binding of pangolin CoV RBDs to ACE2 orthologs from various species suggests a broader host range than that of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, cryo-EM structures of GX/P2V/2017 and GD/1/2019 RBDs in complex with hACE2 show their molecular binding in modes similar to SARS-CoV-2 RBD.

The CenteringPregnancy program is a widely recognized model of prenatal care. Several countries have attempted to implement the program in prenatal care practice; however, its effectiveness on maternal and birth outcomes has not been systematically evaluated and analyzed. Objectives: To determine the effect of the Centering Pregnancy program on improving maternal and birth outcomes, including low birth weight, preterm birth, and postpartum depression. Design: This study evaluated and analyzed randomized controlled trials by comparing the CenteringPregnancy program with o0bstetric led prenatal care. Maternal and birth outcomes of interest included low birthweight, preterm birth, and postpartum depressive symptoms. Data Sources: Embase, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and The Cochrane Library were utilized in this systematic review. Additionally, a supplemental Google Scholar search was performed to capture all relevant articles. Methods: All data were extracted independently by two trained researchers, who evaluated the quality of the study by examining the risk of bias. The biases of selection, allocation, measurement, reporting, and loss of follow-up were assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias for these included randomized controlled trials. A meta-analysis of eligible randomized controlled trials was conducted using Review Manager. Heterogeneity of studies was assessed using the I-2 statistic. Results: Out of 591 articles reviewed, seven randomized controlled trials were included in this study. Findings showed that the CenteringPregnancy program was not associated with lower rates of preterm birth (0.88 [0.71-1.07], p = 0.20, I-2 = 0%), low birth weight (0.87 [0.68-1.12], p = 0.29, I2 = 0%), or 12-month postpartum depressive symptoms (0.07 [-0.12-0.26], p =0.46, I-2 = 69%).

Conclusions: Existing evidence suggests that the CenteringPregnancy program and obstetric led care have similar effects on reducing the rates of preterm birth and low birth weight but different effects on postpartum depressive symptoms. More studies are needed to examine the effect of the CenteringPregnancy program on the improvement of postpartum depressive symptoms.

Less than 9% of the African population is serviced by an emergency medical services transportation system, and nearly two-thirds of African countries do not have any known EMS system in place. One of the leading reasons for EMS utilization in Africa is for obstetric emergencies. The purpose of this systematic review is to provide a qualitative description and summation of previously described interventions to improve access to care for patients with maternal obstetric emergencies in Africa with the intent of identifying interventions that can innovatively be translated to a broader emergency context. Methods The protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) under the number CRD42018105371. We searched the following electronic databases for all abstracts up to 10/19/2020 in accordance to PRISMA guidelines: PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus and African Index Medicus. Articles were included if they were focused on a specific mode of transportation or an access-to-care solution for hospital or outpatient clinic care in Africa for maternal or traumatic emergency conditions. Exclusion criteria included in-hospital solutions intended to address a lack of access. Reference and citation analyses were performed, and a data quality assessment was conducted. Data analysis was performed using a qualitative metasynthesis approach. Findings A total of 6,457 references were imported for screening and 1,757 duplicates were removed. Of the 4,700 studies that were screened against title and abstract, 4,485 studies were excluded. Finally, 215 studies were assessed for full-text eligibility and 152 studies were excluded. A final count of 63 studies were included in the systematic review. In the 63 studies that were included, there was representation from 20 countries in Africa. The three most common interventions included specific transportation solutions (n = 39), community engagement (n = 28) and education or training initiatives (n = 27). Over half of the studies included more than one category of intervention. Interpretation Emergency care systems across Africa are understudied and interventions to improve access to care for obstetric emergencies provides important insight into existing solutions for other types of emergency conditions. Physical access to means of transportation, efforts to increase layperson knowledge and recognition of emergent conditions, and community engagement hold the most promise for future efforts at improving emergency access to care.",JUN 4,2021,16,6,,,e0252583,10.1371/journal.pone.0252583,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252583,,34086753,WOS:000664640100088,View Full Record in Web of Science

METHODS In a single-group, phase 2 trial, we investigated the activity of sotorasib, administered orally at a dose of 960 mg once daily, in patients with KRAS p.G12C-mutated advanced NSCLC previously treated with standard therapies. The primary end point was objective response (complete or partial response) according to independent central review. Key secondary end points included duration of response, disease control (defined as complete response, partial response, or stable disease), progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety. Exploratory biomarkers were evaluated for their association with response to sotorasib therapy. RESULTS Among the 126 enrolled patients, the majority (81.0%) had previously received both platinum-based chemotherapy and inhibitors of programmed death 1 (PD-1) or programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). According to central review, 124 patients had measurable disease at baseline and were evaluated for response. An objective response was observed in 46 patients (37.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 28.6 to 46.2), including in 4 (3.2%) who had a complete response and in 42 (33.9%) who had a partial response. The median duration of response was 11.1 months (95% CI, 6.9 to could not be evaluated). Disease control occurred in 100 patients (80.6%; 95% CI, 72.6 to 87.2). The median progression-free survival was 6.8 months (95% CI, 5.1 to 8.2), and the median overall survival was 12.5 months (95% CI, 10.0 to could not be evaluated). Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 88 of 126 patients (69.8%), including grade 3 events in 25 patients (19.8%) and a grade 4 event in 1 (0.8%). Responses were observed in subgroups defined according to PD-L1 expression, tumor mutational burden, and co-occurring mutations in STK11, KEAP1, or TP53.

OBJECTIVE To determine the effectiveness of CGM in adults with type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin without prandial insulin in primary care practices. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This randomized clinical trialwas conducted at 15 centers in the US (enrollment from July 30, 2018, to October 30, 2019; follow-up completed July 7, 2020) and included adults with type 2 diabetes receiving their diabetes care from a primary care clinician and treated with 1 or 2 daily injections of long- or intermediate-acting basal insulin without prandial insulin, with or without noninsulin glucose-lowering medications. INTERVENTIONS Random assignment 2:1 to CGM (n = 116) or traditional blood glucose meter (BGM) monitoring (n = 59). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level at 8 months. Key secondary outcomes were CGM-measured time in target glucose range of 70 to 180mg/dL, time with glucose level at greater than 250mg/dL, and mean glucose level at 8 months. RESULTS Among 175 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 57 [9] years; 88 women [50%]; 92 racial/ethnic minority individuals [53%]; mean [SD] baseline HbA1c level, 9.1% [0.9%]), 165 (94%) completed the trial. Mean HbA1c level decreased from 9.1% at baseline to 8.0% at 8 months in the CGM group and from 9.0% to 8.4% in the BGM group (adjusted difference, -0.4%[95% CI, -0.8% to -0.1%]; P =.02). In the CGM group, compared with the BGM group, the mean percentage of CGM-measured time in the target glucose range of 70 to 180mg/dL was 59% vs 43%(adjusted difference, 15%[95% CI, 8% to 23%]; P <.001), the mean percentage of time at greater than 250mg/dL was 11% vs 27%(adjusted difference, -16%[95% CI, -21% to -11%]; P <.001), and the means of the mean glucose values were 179mg/dL vs 206mg/dL (adjusted difference, -26mg/dL [95% CI, -41 to -12]; P <.001). Severe hypoglycemic events occurred in 1 participant (1%) in the CGM group and in 1 (2%) in the BGM group.

We explored whether an embedded pediatric palliative oncology (PPO) clinic is associated with improved pediatric oncology provider palliative care comfort, knowledge, and attitudes toward PPC and if the model is feasible for both clinical care and education of providers of all levels. METHODS: Oncology providers (oncologists, advanced practice providers, and fellows) were enrolled in this study. Based on interaction with the PPO clinic, two cohorts were defined: PPO providers (n = 11, 37.9%) and non-PPO providers (n = 18, 62.1%). Providers in both groups responded to qualitative and quantitative questionnaires about the feasibility and acceptability of PPO clinic, their attitudes toward PPC, and knowledge and comfort in PPC concepts at baseline and 1 year. Descriptive statistics were performed; demographic and outcome variables across cohorts by PPO grouping and experience were compared. RESULTS: All 29 pediatric oncology providers reported acceptability of a PPO clinic and favorable attitudes about PPC. The most feasible clinic model was oncology followed by PPO visits. Non-PPO group and less experienced (<= 10 years) providers had greater improvement in knowledge and comfort with PPC skills than PPO group or more experienced providers. Providers lacked comfort in non-pain symptom management skills. CONCLUSION: This embedded PPO clinic model was feasible, acceptable, and highly rated by responding oncology clinicians, but was insufficient as a sole method of educating multidisciplinary oncology providers.

Method: Data were collected from women veterans (n = 14) who had experienced MST and sought VA PTSD treatment. Data analyses utilized a constructivist grounded theory approach. Findings: The context of the MST experience, including the military environment at the time, the era in which they experienced MST and the response of others to their reporting or disclosure of MST created decades-long barriers to PTSD treatment-seeking.

This study aimed to describe the challenges, approaches, and decisions related to discussing prognosis among a sample of mothers with metastatic cancer. METHODS: We conducted a web-based cross-sectional survey assessing the psychosocial concerns of 224 women with metastatic cancer who had minor children. This analysis focused on participant responses to structured and open-ended questions addressing communication with their children. We used descriptive statistics to summarize responses to the structured questions and qualitative content analysis for responses to open-ended questions. RESULTS: Nearly 80% (n = 176) reported they had discussed their prognosis with at least one of their children; 79% identified at least one barrier to these discussions. The most common obstacles were participants' uncertainty about their illness trajectory (43%) and emotional distress associated with these conversations (41%). Qualitative analyses revealed three principles that guided mothers' communication decisions: commitment to honesty and protection; child developmental readiness; and beliefs about the right time. Approaches to discussing prognosis included total honesty, using the language of chronic illness, gradual disclosure, waiting for questions, and emphasizing hope, love, and reassurance.

However, growth of the evidence is still slow due to challenges with designing and testing self-care interventions. In this article we address major methodological challenges with regard to the definition of self-care, use of theory, and research design, intended to provide guidance to researchers in this field. Method: During the inaugural conference of the International Center for Self-Care Research held in Rome, Italy in June 2019 we identified important issues in existing self-care research. Discussion and literature review lead to eight recommendation for future self-care research. Results: In preparation, begin with a theoretically sound definition of self-care. In planning the intervention, build on and extend previous studies. Use theory to develop self-care interventions and consider translational models to guide development, evaluation and implementation of complex self-care interventions. Employ a study design that fits the current phase and objectives of the research and measure self-care and related factors carefully. In reporting, describe the sample and setting sufficiently so that others can draw conclusions about generalizability and applicability to their practice and patient population. In interpretation, describe how the intervention is assumed to work (causal assumptions) and its key components. Conclusion: Our review of existing self-care research clearly illustrates that the recommendations we provide are needed if we are to substantially grow the evidence base supporting self-care.

The gradient is achieved by swelling a composite film made of polycaprolactone (PCL) and hydroxyapatite (HAp) nanoparticles with a PCL solution. During the swelling process, the solvent and PCL polymer chains diffuse into the composite film, generating a gradient in HAp density at their interface. The thickness of the mineral gradient can be tuned by varying the extent of swelling to match the length scale of the natural tendon-to-bone attachment (20-60 mu m). When patterned with an array of funnel-shaped channels, the mineral gradient presents stem cells with spatial gradations in both biochemical cues (e.g., osteoinductivity and conductivity associated with the HAp nanoparticles) and mechanical cues (e.g., substrate stiffness) to stimulate their differentiation into a graded distribution of cell phenotypes.

Where are we going?,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES,Article,"Background and objective: The beneficial effects of self-care include improved well-being and lower morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. In this article we address the current state of self-care research and propose an agenda for future research based on the inaugural conference of the International Center for Self-Care Research held in Rome, Italy in June 2019. The vision of this Center is a world where self-care is prioritized by individuals, families, and communities and is the first line of approach in every health care encounter. The mission of the Center is to lead the self-care research endeavor, improving conceptual clarity and promoting interdisciplinary work informed by a shared vision addressing knowledge gaps. A focused research agenda can deepen our theoretical understanding of self-care and the mechanisms underlying self-care, which can contribute to the development of effective interventions that improve outcomes. Methods: During conference discussions, we identified seven major reasons why self-care is challenging, which can be grouped into the general categories of behavior change and illness related factors. We identified six specific knowledge gaps that, if addressed, may help to address these challenges: the influence of habit formation on behavior change, resilience in the face of stressful life events that interfere with self-care, the influence of culture on self-care behavioral choices, the difficulty performing self-care with multiple chronic conditions, self-care in persons with severe mental illness, and the influence of others (care partners, family, peer supporters, and healthcare professionals) on self-care. Plans to achieve results: To achieve the vision and mission of the Center, we will lead a collaborative program of research that addresses self-care knowledge gaps and improves outcomes, create a supportive international network for knowledge transfer and support of innovations in self-care research, and support and train others in self-care research. Beyond these specific short-term goals, important policy implications of this work are discussed. (c) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We aimed to describe and share our experience using #neoEBM (Neonatal Evidence Based Medicine) hashtag to organise and build a digital community of neonatal care practice. Materials and methods Analysis of #neoEBM Twitter data in the Symplur Signals database between 1 May 2018 to 9 January 2021. Data on tweets containing the #neoEBM hashtag were analysed using online analytical tools, including the total number of tweets and user engagement. Results Since its registration, a total of 3 228 distinct individual Twitter users used the hashtag with 23 939 tweets and 37 259 710 impressions generated. The two days with the greatest number of tweets containing #neoEBM were 8 May 2018 (n = 218) and 28 April 2019 (n = 340), coinciding with the annual Pediatric Academic Societies meeting. The majority of Twitter users made one tweet using #neoEBM (n = 1078), followed by two tweets (n = 411) and more than 10 tweets (n = 347). The number of individual impressions (views) of tweets containing #neoEBM was 37 259 710. Of the 23 939 tweets using #neoEBM, 17 817 (74%) were retweeted (shared), 15 643 (65%) included at least one link and 1 196 (5%) had at least one reply. As #neoEBM users increased over time, so did tweets containing #neoEBM, with each additional user of the hashtag associated with a mean increase in 7.8 (95% CI 7.7-8.0) tweets containing #neoEBM. Conclusion Our findings support the observation that the #neoEBM community possesses many of the characteristics of a community of practice, and it may be an effective tool to disseminate research findings. By sharing our experiences, we hope to encourage others to engage with or build online digital communities of practice to share knowledge and build collaborative networks across disciplines, institutions and countries.",MAY 28,2021,16,5,,,e0252472,10.1371/journal.pone.0252472,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252472,,34048469,WOS:000664636100056,View Full Record in Web of Science

In young healthy people and animals, muscles are activated in a precise temporal and spatial organization when the center of body mass (CoM) is unexpectedly moved that is largely automatic and determined by feedback of CoM motion. Here, we show that PD alters the sensitivity of the sensorimotor feedback transformation. Importantly, sensorimotor feedback transformations for balance in PD remain temporally precise, but become spatially diffuse by recruiting additional muscle activity in antagonist muscles during balance responses. The abnormal antagonist muscle activity remains precisely time-locked to sensorimotor feedback signals encoding undesirable motion of the body in space. Further, among people with PD, the sensitivity of abnormal antagonist muscle activity to CoM motion varies directly with the number of recent falls. Our work shows that in people with PD, sensorimotor feedback transformations for balance are intact but disinhibited in antagonist muscles, likely contributing to balance deficits and falls.",MAY 27,2021,16,5,,,e0252119,10.1371/journal.pone.0252119,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252119,,34043678,WOS:000664635700054,View Full Record in Web of Science

To fill this gap, we conducted a qualitative study with women living with or at risk for HIV in the United States. Methods We conducted 24 in-depth interviews with women enrolled in the San Francisco and Atlanta sites of the Women's Interagency HIV study (WIHS). Participants were purposively sampled so half were living with HIV and all reported food insecurity and IPV in the past year. Semi-structured interviews explored experiences with food insecurity and IPV, how these experiences might be related and influence HIV risk and treatment behaviors. Analysis was guided by an inductive-deductive approach. Results A predominant theme centered on how food insecurity and IPV co-occur with poor mental health and substance use to influence HIV-related behaviors. Women described how intersecting experiences of food insecurity and IPV negatively affected their mental health, with many indicating using substances to feel no pain. Substance use, in turn, was described to perpetuate food insecurity, IPV, and poor mental health in a vicious cycle, ultimately facilitating HIV risk behaviors and preventing HIV treatment adherence. Conclusions Food insecurity, IPV, poor mental health and substance use intersect and negatively influence HIV prevention and treatment behaviors. Findings offer preliminary evidence of a syndemic that goes beyond the more widely studied SAVA (substance use, AIDS, and violence) syndemic, drawing attention to additional constructs of mental health and food insecurity. Quantitative research must further characterize the extent and size of this syndemic. Policies that address the social and structural drivers of this syndemic, including multi-level and trauma-informed approaches, should be implemented and evaluated to assess their impact on this syndemic and its negative health effects.",MAY 26,2021,16,5,,,e0252338,10.1371/journal.pone.0252338,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252338,,34038490,WOS:000664633500074,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Rosa, LG; Zia, JS; Inan, OT; Sawicki, GS","Rosa, Luis G.; Zia, Jonathan S.; Inan, Omer T.; Sawicki, Gregory S.",,Machine learning to extract muscle fascicle length changes from dynamic ultrasound images in real-time,PLOS ONE,Article,"Background and objective Dynamic muscle fascicle length measurements through B-mode ultrasound have become popular for the non-invasive physiological insights they provide regarding musculoskeletal structure-function. However, current practices typically require time consuming post-processing to track muscle length changes from B-mode images. A real-time measurement tool would not only save processing time but would also help pave the way toward closed-loop applications based on feedback signals driven by in vivo muscle length change patterns. In this paper, we benchmark an approach that combines traditional machine learning (ML) models with B-mode ultrasound recordings to obtain muscle fascicle length changes in real-time. To gauge the utility of this framework for 'in-the-loop' applications, we evaluate accuracy of the extracted muscle length change signals against time-series' derived from a standard, post-hoc automated tracking algorithm. Methods We collected B-mode ultrasound data from the soleus muscle of six participants performing five defined ankle motion tasks: (a) seated, constrained ankle plantarflexion, (b) seated, free ankle dorsi/plantarflexion, (c) weight-bearing, calf raises (d) walking, and then a (e) mix. We trained machine learning (ML) models by pairing muscle fascicle lengths obtained from standardized automated tracking software (UltraTrack) with the respective B-mode ultrasound image input to the tracker, frame-by-frame. Then we conducted hyperparameter optimizations for five different ML models using a grid search to find the best performing parameters for a combination of high correlation and low RMSE between ML and UltraTrack processed muscle fascicle length trajectories. Finally, using the global best model/hyperparameter settings, we comprehensively evaluated training-testing outcomes within subject (i.e., train and test on same subject), cross subject (i.e., train on one subject, test on another) and within/direct cross task (i.e., train and test on same subject, but different task). Results Support vector machine (SVM) was the best performing model with an average r = 0.70 0.34 and average RMSE = 2.86 +/- 2.55 mm across all direct training conditions and average r = 0.65 +/- 0.35 and average RMSE = 3.28 +/- 2.64 mm when optimized for all cross-participant conditions. Comparisons between ML vs. UltraTrack (i.e., ground truth) tracked muscle fascicle length versus time data indicated that ML tracked images reliably capture the salient qualitative features in ground truth length change data, even when correlation values are on the lower end. Furthermore, in the direct training, calf raises condition, which is most comparable to previous studies validating automated tracking performance during isolated contractions on a dynamometer, our ML approach yielded 0.90 average correlation, in line with other accepted tracking methods in the field. Conclusions By combining B-mode ultrasound and classical ML models, we demonstrate it is possible to achieve real-time tracking of human soleus muscle fascicles across a number of functionally relevant contractile conditions. This novel sensing modality paves the way for muscle physiology in-the-loop applications that could be used to modify gait via biofeedback or unlock novel wearable device control techniques that could enable restored or augmented locomotion performance.",MAY 26,2021,16,5,,,e0246611,10.1371/journal.pone.0246611,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246611,,34038426,WOS:000664633500004,View Full Record in Web of Science

We aimed to evaluate the role of F-18-fluciclovine-PET/CT in improving cancer control compared with conventional imaging (bone scan and either CT or MRI) alone for salvage postprostatectomy radiotherapy. Methods In EMPIRE-1, a single-centre, open-label, phase 2/3 randomised controlled trial, patients with prostate cancer with detectable PSA after prostatectomy and negative conventional imaging (no extrapelvic or bone findings) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to radiotherapy directed by conventional imaging alone or to conventional imaging plus F-18-fluciclovine-PET/CT. Computer-generated randomisation was stratified by PSA concentration, adverse pathology indicators, and androgen deprivation therapy intent. In the F-18-fluciclovine-PET/CT group, radiotherapy decisions were rigidly determined by PET findings, which were also used for target delineation. The primary endpoint was 3 year event-free survival, with events defined as biochemical or clinical recurrence or progression, or initiation of systemic therapy, using univariate and multivariable analyses in patients who received radiotherapy. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01666808 and is closed to new participants. Findings From Sept 18, 2012, to March 4, 2019, 165 patients were randomly assigned, with median follow-up of 3.52 years (95% CI 2.98-3.95). PET findings resulted in four patients in the F-18-fluciclovine-PET/CT group having radiotherapy aborted; these patients were excluded from survival analyses. Median survival was not reached (95% CI 35.2-not reached; 33% of 81 patients had events) in the conventional imaging group compared with not reached (95% CI not reached-not reached; 20% of 76 patients) in the F-18-fluciclovine-PET/CT group, and 3 year event-free survival was 63.0% (95% CI 49.2-74.0) in the conventional imaging group versus 75.5% (95% CI 62.5-84.6) for F-18-fluciclovine-PET/CT (difference 12.5; 95% CI 4.3-20.8; p=0.0028). In adjusted analyses, study group (hazard ratio 2.04 [95% CI 1.06-3.93], p=0.0327) was significantly associated with event-free survival. Toxicity was similar in both study groups, with the most common adverse events being late urinary frequency or urgency (37 [46%] of 81 patients in the conventional imaging group and 31 [41%] of 76 in the PET group), and acute diarrhoea (11 [14%] in the conventional imaging group and 16 [21%] in the PET group). Interpretation Inclusion of F-18-fluciclovine-PET into postprostatectomy radiotherapy decision making and planning significantly improved survival free from biochemical recurrence or persistence.

Social deficits such as those present in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other psychiatric disorders hinder the individual's functioning in communities. Given that early diagnosis and intervention can improve outcomes and trajectories of ASD, there is a great need for tools to identify early markers for screening/diagnosis, and for translational animal models to uncover biological mechanisms and develop treatments. One of the most widely used screening tools for ASD in children is the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), a quantitative measure used to identify individuals with atypical social behaviors. The SRS has been adapted for use in adult rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta)-a species very close to humans in terms of social behavior, brain anatomy/connectivity and development-but has not yet been validated or adapted for a necessary downward extension to younger ages matching those for ASD diagnosis in children. The goal of the present study was to adapt and validate the adult macaque SRS (mSRS) in juvenile macaques with age equivalent to mid-childhood in humans. Expert primate coders modified the mSRS to adapt it to rate atypical social behaviors in juvenile macaques living in complex social groups at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center. Construct and face validity of this juvenile mSRS (jmSRS) was determined based on well-established and operationalized measures of social and non-social behaviors in this species using traditional behavioral observations. We found that the jmSRS identifies variability in social responsiveness of juvenile rhesus monkeys and shows strong construct/predictive validity, as well as sensitivity to detect atypical social behaviors in young male and female macaques across social status. Thus, the jmSRS provides a promising tool for translational research on macaque models of children social disorders.",MAY 20,2021,16,5,,,e0235946,10.1371/journal.pone.0235946,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235946,,34014933,WOS:000664631600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

METHODS SEER records of women of age >= 20 years diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer from 2013 to 2017 in California or Georgia were linked to the results of clinical germline testing through 2019. We measured testing trends, rates of variants of uncertain significance (VUS), and pathogenic variants (PVs). RESULTS One quarter (25.2%) of 187,535 patients with breast cancer and one third (34.3%) of 14,689 patients with ovarian cancer were tested; annually, testing increased by 2%, whereas the number of genes tested increased by 28%. The prevalence of test results by gene category for breast cancer cases in 2017 were BRCA1/2, PVs 5.2%, and VUS 0.8%; breast cancer-associated genes or ovarian cancer-associated genes (ATM, BARD1, BRIP1, CDH1, CHEK2, EPCAM, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, NBN, NF1, PALB2, PMS2, PTEN, RAD51C, RAD51D, STK11, and TP53), PVs 3.7%, and VUS 12.0%; other actionable genes (APC, BMPR1A, MEN1, MUTYH, NF2, RB1, RET, SDHAF2, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SMAD4, TSC1, TSC2, and VHL) PVs 0.6%, and VUS 0.5%; and other genes, PVs 0.3%, and VUS 2.6%. For ovarian cancer cases in 2017, the prevalence of test results were BRCA1/2, PVs 11.0%, and VUS 0.9%; breast or ovarian genes, PVs 4.0%, and VUS 12.6%; other actionable genes, PVs 0.7%, and VUS 0.4%; and other genes, PVs 0.3%, and VUS 0.6%. VUS rates doubled over time (2013 diagnoses: 11.2%; 2017 diagnoses: 26.8%), particularly for racial or ethnic minorities (47.8% Asian and 46.0% Black, v 24.6% non-Hispanic White patients; P < .001). CONCLUSION A testing gap persists for patients with ovarian cancer (34.3% tested v nearly all recommended), whereas adding more genes widened a racial or ethnic gap in VUS results. Most PVs were in 20 breast cancer-associated genes or ovarian cancer-associated genes; testing other genes yielded mostly VUS. Quality improvement should focus on testing indicated patients rather than adding more genes.",MAY 20,2021,39,15,1631,+,,10.1200/JCO.20.02785,http://dx.doi.org/10.1200/JCO.20.02785,,33560870,WOS:000708087300004,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, direct targeting of loss-offunction tumor suppressors remains challenging. To address this gap, we explored a variant-directed chemical biology approach to reverse the lost function of tumor suppressors using SMAD4 as an example. SMAD4, a central mediator of the TGF-beta pathway, is recurrently mutated in many tumors. Here, we report the development of a TR-FRET technology that recapitulated the dynamic differential interaction of SMAD4 and SMAD4(R361H) with SMAD3 and identified Ro-31-8220, a bisindolylmaleimide derivative, as a SMAD4(R361H)/ SMAD3 interaction inducer. Ro-31-8220 reactivated the dormant SMAD4(R361H)-mediated transcriptional activity and restored TGF-b-induced tumor suppression activity in SMAD4 mutant cancer cells. Thus, demonstration of Ro-31-8220 as a SMAD4(R361H)/SMAD3 interaction inducer illustrates a general strategy to reverse the lost function of tumor suppressors with hypomorph mutations and supports a systematic approach to develop small-molecule protein-protein interaction (PPI) molecular glues for biological insights and therapeutic discovery.",MAY 20,2021,28,5,636,+,,10.1016/j.chembiol.2020.11.010,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chembiol.2020.11.010,,33326750,WOS:000654307600007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Translating these risk variants into mechanistic insights requires detailed maps of gene regulation in disease-relevant cell types(2). Here we combined two approaches: a genome-wide association study of type 1 diabetes (T1D) using 520,580 samples, and the identification of candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) in pancreas and peripheral blood mononuclear cells using single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (snATAC-seq) of 131,554 nuclei. Risk variants for T1D were enriched in cCREs that were active in T cells and other cell types, including acinar and ductal cells of the exocrine pancreas. Risk variants at multiple T1D signals overlapped with exocrine-specific cCREs that were linked to genes with exocrine-specific expression. At the CFTR locus, the T1D risk variant rs7795896 mapped to a ductal-specific cCRE that regulated CFTR; the risk allele reduced transcription factor binding, enhancer activity and CFTR expression in ductal cells.

This systematic review summarises the early literature on clinical characteristics of patients admitted to hospital, and evaluates the quality of evidence produced during the initial stages of the pandemic. Methods MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health databases were searched for studies published from January 1(st) 2020 to April 28(th) 2020. Studies which reported on at least 100 hospitalised patients with Covid-19 of any age were included. Data on clinical characteristics were independently extracted by two review authors. Study design specific critical appraisal tools were used to evaluate included studies: the Newcastle Ottawa scale for cohort and cross sectional studies, Joanna Briggs Institute checklist for case series and the Cochrane collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias in randomised trials. Results The search yielded 78 studies presenting data on 77,443 people. Most studies (82%) were conducted in China. No studies included patients from low- and middle-income countries. The overall quality of included studies was low to moderate, and the majority of studies did not include a control group. Fever and cough were the most commonly reported symptoms early in the pandemic. Laboratory and imaging findings were diverse with lymphocytopenia and ground glass opacities the most common findings respectively. Clinical data in children and vulnerable populations were limited. Conclusions The early Covid-19 literature had moderate to high risk of bias and presented several methodological issues. Early clinical characterisation studies should aim to include different at-risk populations, including patients in non-hospital settings. Pandemic preparedness requires collection tools to ensure observational studies are methodologically robust and will help produce high-quality data early on in the pandemic to guide clinical practice and public health policy.

Significant signal enrichment was found in genes encoding targets of antipsychotics, calcium channel blockers, antiepileptics and anesthetics. Integrating expression quantitative trait locus data implicated 15 genes robustly linked to bipolar disorder via gene expression, encoding druggable targets such as HTR6, MCHR1, DCLK3 and FURIN. Analyses of bipolar disorder subtypes indicated high but imperfect genetic correlation between bipolar disorder type I and II and identified additional associated loci.

Endocrine markers in urine and saliva may provide an objective, sensitive, and non-invasive method for assessing development. Objective Our objective was to examine whether changes in endocrine levels can indicate the onset of pubertal development prior to changes in self-rated Tanner stage. Methods Thirty-five girls and 42 boys aged 7 to 15 years were enrolled in the Growth and Puberty (GAP) study, a longitudinal pilot study conducted from 2007-2009 involving children of women enrolled in the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) in Iowa. We collected saliva and urine samples and assessed pubertal development by self-rated Tanner staging (pubic hair, breast development (girls), genital development (boys)) at three visits over six months. We measured dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in saliva and creatinine-adjusted luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), estrone 3-glucuronide (E(1)3G) and pregnanediol 3-glucuronide (Pd3G) concentrations in first morning urine. We evaluated the relationships over time between Tanner stage and each biomarker using repeated measures analysis. Results Among girls still reporting Tanner breast stage 1 at the final visit, FSH levels increased over the 6-month follow-up period and were no longer lower than higher stage girls at the end of follow-up. We observed a similar pattern for testosterone in boys. By visit 3, boys still reporting Tanner genital stage 1 or pubic hair stage 1 had attained DHEA levels that were comparable to those among boys reporting Tanner stages 2 or 3. Conclusions Increasing concentrations of FSH in girls and DHEA and testosterone in boys over a 6-month period revealed the start of the pubertal process prior to changes in self-rated Tanner stage. Repeated, non-invasive endocrine measures may complement the more subjective assessment of physical markers in studies determining pubertal onset.",MAY 13,2021,16,5,,,e0251598,10.1371/journal.pone.0251598,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0251598,,33984062,WOS:000664628200102,View Full Record in Web of Science

During pregnancy, about 15-25% of maternal plasma exosomes, a small size-class of EVs, are hypothesized to originate in the placenta, and may play a role in communication between the fetus and mother. However, few studies have addressed changes in miRNA over the course of pregnancy with repeated measures, nor focused on diverse populations. We describe changes in miRNA in early and late pregnancy from the MADRES cohort of primarily low-income Hispanic women based in Los Angeles, CA. miRNA derived from extracellular-vesicles (EVs) were isolated from maternal blood plasma samples collected in early and late pregnancy. In this study, we identified 64 of 130 detectable miRNA which significantly increased with gestational age at the time of collection (GA), and 26 which decreased with GA. Possible fetal sex-specific associations were observed for 30 of these 90 significant miRNA. Predicted gene targets for miRNA significantly associated with GA were identified using MirDIP and were found to be enriched for Gene Ontology categories that included energetic and metabolic processes but were underrepresented in immune-related categories.

Recombinant protein vaccines can overcome the safety concerns and long production phase of virus-based influenza vaccines. However, soluble protein vaccines are poorly immunogenic if administered by an i.n. route. Here, we report that polyethyleneimine-functionalized graphene oxide nanoparticles (GP nanoparticles) showed high antigen-loading capacities and superior immunoenhancing properties. Via a facile electrostatic adsorption approach, influenza hemagglutinin (HA) was incorporated into GP nanoparticles and maintained structural integrity and antigenicity. The resulting GP nanoparticles enhanced antigen internalization and promoted inflammatory cytokine production and JAWS II dendritic cell maturation. Compared with soluble HA, GP nanoparticle formulations induced significantly enhanced and cross-reactive immune responses at both systemic sites and mucosal surfaces in mice after i.n. immunization. In the absence of any additional adjuvant, the GP nanoparticle significantly boosted antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses, comparable to the acknowledged potent mucosal immunomodulator CpG. The robust immune responses conferred immune protection against challenges by homologous and heterologous viruses. Additionally, the solid self-adjuvant effect of GP nanoparticles may mask the role of CpG when coincorporated. In the absence of currently approved mucosal adjuvants, GP nanoparticles can be developed into potent i.n. influenza vaccines, providing broad protection.

We evaluated the relationship between the severity of the Great Recession's aftermath and spatial access to combined prevention services (i.e. HIV testing, syringe service programs, substance use disorder treatment program) for people who inject drugs (PWID) living in 19 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the United States. Methods: The unit of analysis was the ZIP code; we sampled ZIP codes in these 19 MSAs where >= 1 PWID lived in 2009 and 2012, according to the CDC's National HIV Behavioral Surveillance. We used administrative data to describe the combined prevention environment (i.e., spatial access to HIV testing) for each ZIP code, and measured the severity of the recession's aftermath in each ZIP code, and in the counties and MSAs where these ZIP codes were located. Multilevel modeling estimated associations between changes in the aftermath of the Great Recession and ZIP code-level changes in spatial access to combined prevention services from 2009 to 2012. Results: 675 ZIP codes located in 36 counties and 19 MSAs were included in this analysis. From 2009 to 2012, 21% of ZIP code areas lost access to combined prevention services and 14% gained access. ZIP codes with higher poverty rates relative to their respective MSAs were less likely to lose access (aOR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.88, 0.95) and more likely to gain access (aOR: 1.05; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.09); there is some evidence to suggest the former association was attenuated for ZIP codes with higher percentages of non-Hispanic white residents. Conclusion: Combined prevention services for PWID living in these 675 ZIP codes demonstrated resilience in the aftermath of the Great Recession. Future research should explore whether community-based and federal HIV prevention initiatives contributed to this resilience, particularly in areas with higher concentrations of people of color.",SEP,2021,95,,,,103264,10.1016/j.drugpo.2021.103264,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2021.103264,MAY 2021,33990058,WOS:000705663700016,View Full Record in Web of Science

This report summarizes the safety data from the overall safety population (OSP) and efficacy data, including additional disease cohorts not published previously. Patients and methods: Patients with refractory metastatic epithelial cancers received intravenous SG (8, 10, 12, or 18 mg/kg) on days 1 and 8 of 21-day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Endpoints for the OSP included safety and pharmacokinetic parameters with investigator-evaluated objective response rate (ORR per RECIST 1.1), duration of response, clinical benefit rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival evaluated for cohorts (n > 10 patients) of small-cell lung, colorectal, esophageal, endometrial, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Results: In the OSP (n = 495, median age 61 years, 68% female; UGT1A1*28 homozygous, n = 46; 9.3%), 41 (8.3%) permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse events (AEs). Most common treatment-related AEs were nausea (62.6%), diarrhea (56.2%), fatigue (48.3%), alopecia (40.4%), and neutropenia (57.8%). Most common treatment-related serious AEs (n = 75; 15.2%) were febrile neutropenia (4.0%) and diarrhea (2.8%). Grade >= 3 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia occurred in 42.4% and 5.3% of patients, respectively. Neutropenia (all grades) was numerically more frequent in UGT1A1*28 homozygotes (28/46; 60.9%) than heterozygotes (69/180; 38.3%) or UGT1A1*1 wild type (59/177; 33.3%). There was one treatment-related death due to an AE of aspiration pneumonia. Partial responses were seen in endometrial cancer (4/18, 22.2% ORR) and small-cell lung cancer (11/62, 17.7% ORR), and one castrate-resistant prostate cancer patient had a complete response (n = 1/11; 9.1% ORR).

We analyzed a cohort of patients with cancer and coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) reported to the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) to identify prognostic clinical factors, including laboratory measurements and anticancer therapies. Patients and methods: Patients with active or historical cancer and a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis recorded between 17 March and 18 November 2020 were included. The primary outcome was COVID-19 severity measured on an ordinal scale (uncomplicated, hospitalized, admitted to intensive care unit, mechanically ventilated, died within 30 days). Multivariable regression models included demographics, cancer status, anticancer therapy and timing, COVID-19-directed therapies, and laboratory measurements (among hospitalized patients). Results: A total of 4966 patients were included (median age 66 years, 51% female, 50% non-Hispanic white); 2872 (58%) were hospitalized and 695 (14%) died; 61% had cancer that was present, diagnosed, or treated within the year prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. Older age, male sex, obesity, cardiovascular and pulmonary comorbidities, renal disease, diabetes mellitus, non-Hispanic black race, Hispanic ethnicity, worse Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, recent cytotoxic chemotherapy, and hematologic malignancy were associated with higher COVID-19 severity. Among hospitalized patients, low or high absolute lymphocyte count; high absolute neutrophil count; low platelet count; abnormal creatinine; troponin; lactate dehydrogenase; and C-reactive protein were associated with higher COVID-19 severity. Patients diagnosed early in the COVID-19 pandemic (January-April 2020) had worse outcomes than those diagnosed later. Specific anticancer therapies (e.g. R-CHOP, platinum combined with etoposide, and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors) were associated with high 30-day all-cause mortality. Conclusions: Clinical factors (e.g. older age, hematological malignancy, recent chemotherapy) and laboratory measurements were associated with poor outcomes among patients with cancer and COVID-19.

Here, we developed a novel head impact system to investigate the long-term effects of mild head trauma on brain structure and function, as well as the underlying mechanisms in Drosophila melanogaster. We find that Drosophila subjected to repetitive head impacts develop long-term deficits, including impaired startle-induced climbing, progressive brain degeneration, and shortened lifespan, all of which are substantially exacerbated in female flies. Interestingly, head impacts elicit an elevation in neuronal activity and its acute suppression abrogates the detrimental effects in female flies. Together, our findings validate Drosophila as a suitable model system for investigating the long-term effects of mild head trauma, suggest an increased vulnerability to brain injury in female flies, and indicate that early altered neuronal excitability may be a key mechanism linking mild brain trauma to chronic degeneration.",MAY 6,2021,11,1,,,9738,10.1038/s41598-021-89121-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-89121-7,,33958652,WOS:000656989400009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Increasing demand and insufficient supply for donor RBCs, especially those of universal blood types or free of known and unknown pathogens, has called for ex vivo generation of functional RBCs by large-scale cell culture. However, generating physiological numbers of transfusable cultured RBCs (cRBCs) ex vivo remains challenging, due to our inability to either extensively expand primary RBC precursors (erythroblasts) or achieve efficient enucleation once erythroblasts have been expanded and induced to differentiation and maturation. Here, we report that ectopic expression of the human BMI1 gene confers extensive expansion of human erythroblasts, which can be derived readily from adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells of either healthy donors or sickle cell patients. These extensively expanded erythroblasts (E3s) are able to proliferate exponentially (>1 trillion-fold in 2 months) in a defined culture medium. Expanded E3 cells are karyotypically normal and capable of terminal maturation with approximately 50% enucleation. Additionally, E3-derived cRBCs can circulate in a mouse model following transfusion similar to primary human RBCs.

While free-text clinic notes may offer the greatest nuance and detail about a patient's clinical status, they are largely excluded in previous predictive models due to the increase in processing complexity and need for a complex modeling framework. In this study, we developed a weak-supervision framework for breast cancer recurrence prediction in which we trained a deep learning model on a large sample of free-text clinic notes by utilizing a combination of manually curated labels and NLP-generated non-perfect recurrence labels. The model was trained jointly on manually curated data from 670 patients and NLP-curated data of 8062 patients.

Some low-income countries (LIC) achieved remarkable success in childhood immunisation. Yet, previous studies comparing the relationship between economic growth and health spending with vaccination coverage have been limited. We investigated these relationships among LIC to understand what financial changes lead to childhood immunisation changes. Methods We identified which financial indicators were significant predictors of vaccination coverage in LIC by fitting regression models for several vaccines, controlling for population density, land area and female years of education. We then identified LIC with high vaccination coverage (LIC+) and compared their economic and health spending trends with other LIC (LIC-) and lower-middle income countries. We used cross-country multi-year regressions with mixed-effects to test financial indicators' rate of change. We conducted statistical tests to verify if financial trends of LIC+ were significantly different from LIC-. Results During 2014-2018, gross domestic product per capita (p=0.67-0.95, range given by tests with different vaccines), total/private health spending per capita (p=0.57-0.97, p=0.32-0.57) and aggregated development assistance for health (DAH) per capita (p=0.38-0.86) were not significant predictors of vaccination coverage in LIC. Government health spending per capita (p=0.022-0.073) and total/government spending per birth on routine immunisation vaccines (p=0.0007-0.029, p=0.016-0.052) were significant positive predictors of vaccination coverage. From 2000 to 2016, LIC+ increased government health spending per capita by US$0.30 per year, while LIC- decreased by US$0.16 (significant difference, p<0.0001). From 2006 to 2017, LIC+ increased government spending per birth on routine immunisation vaccines by US$0.22 per year, while LIC- increased by US$0.10 (p<0.0093).

We assessed the effect of objective and perceived neighborhood food access on self-reported cardiovascular disease (CVD) among Black people living in areas of high risk and low risk for the disease in Atlanta, Georgia. We hypothesized that perceived and objective food access would inde-pendently predict self-reported CVD. Methods We used survey data from the Morehouse-Emory Cardiovascular (MECA) Center for Health Equity Study. Study participants con -sisted of 1,402 Black adults, aged 35 to 64, residing in urban At-lanta census tracts with high rates or low rates of CVD. We as-sessed perceived neighborhood healthy food access by self-reported selection and quality of produce and low-fat food options. We assessed objective food access by the 2015 US Department of Agriculture Food Access Research Atlas. Low access was defined as census tracts with at least 500 people living more than 1 mile from a large food retailer. Self-reported CVD included related conditions and/or procedures. We used multilevel logistic models adjusted for demographic characteristics to examine the associ-ation between objective and perceived food access and self-reported CVD. Results Overall, self-reported CVD was not significant for perceived (odds ratio = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.59-1.29) or objective (odds ratio = 0.74; 95% CI, 0.48-1.12) healthy food access.

To maximise the effect of vector control, areas with persistently high numbers of Aedes-borne disease cases could be identified and prioritised for preventive interventions. We aimed to identify persistent Aedes-borne disease hotspots in cities across southern Mexico. Methods In this spatial analysis, geocoded cases of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika from nine endemic Mexican cities were aggregated at the census-tract level. We included cities that were located in southern Mexico (the arbovirus endemic region of Mexico), with a high burden of dengue cases (ie, more than 5000 cases reported during a 10-year period), and listed as high priority for the Mexican dengue control and prevention programme. The Getis-Ord Gi*(d) statistic was applied to yearly slices of the dataset to identify spatial hotspots of each disease in each city. We used Kendall's W coefficient to quantify the agreement in the distribution of each virus. Findings 128 507 dengue, 4752 chikungunya and 25 755 Zika clinical cases were reported between Jan 1, 2008, and Dec 31, 2016. All cities showed evidence of transmission heterogeneity, with a mean of 17.6% (SD 4.7) of their total area identified as persistent disease hotspots. Hotspots accounted for 25.6% (SD 9.7; range 12.8-43.0) of the population and 32.1% (10.5; 19 & middot;6-50.5) of all Aedes-borne disease cases reported. We found an overlap between hotspots of 61.7% for dengue and Zika and 53.3% for dengue and chikungunya. Dengue hotspots in 2008-16 were significantly associated with dengue hotspots detected during 2017-20 in five of the nine cities. Heads of vector control confirmed hotspot areas as problem zones for arbovirus transmission. Interpretation This study provides evidence of the overlap of Aedes-borne diseases within geographical hotspots and a methodological framework for the stratification of arbovirus transmission risk within urban areas, which can guide the implementation of surveillance and vector control.

Here, it is compared how soluble and biomaterial-mediated delivery of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-targeted adjuvants, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA, TLR4 ligand) and 5'-C-phosphate-G-3' DNA (CpG DNA, TLR9 ligand), modulate 3D chemotaxis of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) toward lymphatic chemokine gradients. Within microfluidic devices containing 3D collagen-based matrices to mimic tissue conditions, soluble MPLA increases BMDC chemotaxis toward gradients of CCL19 and CCL21, while soluble CpG has no effect. Delivering CpG on poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid microparticles (MPs) enhances BMDC chemotaxis compared to MPLA-encapsulated MPs, and when co-delivered, MPLA and CpG do not synergistically enhance BMDC migration. It is concluded that supplementing granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor-derived BMDC culture with interleukin-4 is necessary to induce CCR7 expression and chemotaxis of BMDCs. Different cell subsets in BMDC culture upregulate CCR7 in response to soluble versus biomaterial-loaded MPLA and CpG, and CCR7 expression does not consistently correlate with functional migration.

Accurate screening and estimates of anemia prevalence are critical for successful anemia control. Evidence is mixed on the performance of HemoCue, a point-of-care testing device most widely used for large-scale surveys. The use of dried blood spots (DBS) to assess hemoglobin (Hb) concentration is a potential alternative, particularly in field settings. The objective of this study is to assess Hb measurement agreement between capillary HemoCue and DBS among two age groups, children 6-59 months and females age 12-40 years. We analyzed data from the baseline round of a cluster randomized rice fortification intervention in Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu, India. Capillary blood was collected from a subset of participants for Hb assessment by HemoCue 301 and DBS methods. We calculated Lin's concordance correlation coefficient, and tested bias by conducting paired t-tests of Hb concentration. Independence of the bias and Hb magnitude was examined visually using Bland-Altman plots and statistically tested by Pearson's correlation. We assessed differences in anemia classification using McNemar's test of marginal homogeneity. Concordance between HemoCue and DBS Hb measures was moderate for both children 6-59 months (rho (c)=0.67; 95% CI 0.65, 0.71) and females 12-40 years (rho (c)=0.67: 95% CI 0.64, 0.69). HemoCue measures were on average 0.06 g/dL higher than DBS for children (95% CI 0.002, 0.12; p=0.043) and 0.29 g/dL lower than DBS for females (95% CI - 0.34, - 0.23; p<0.0001). 50% and 56% of children were classified as anemic according to HemoCue and DBS, respectively (p<0.0001). 55% and 47% of females were classified as anemic according to HemoCue and DBS, respectively (p<0.0001).

We assessed the feasibility of conducting a population-based study in India to examine the distributions and levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia in relation to oral leukoplakia (a potentially malignant disorder) and other participant characteristics. Methods This exploratory case-control study was nested within a large urban Indian cohort and the data included 22 men and women with oral leukoplakia (cases) and 69 leukoplakia-free controls. Each participant provided a salivary rinse sample, and a subset of 34 participants (9 cases; 25 controls) also provided a gingival swab sample from keratinized gingival surface for quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Results Neither the distribution nor the levels of pathogens were associated with oral leukoplakia; however, individual pathogen levels were more strongly correlated with each other in cases compared to controls. Among controls, the median level of total pathogens was the highest (7.55x10(4) copies/ng DNA) among persons of low socioeconomic status.

Here we aimed to disentangle the functional roles of co-released NE and galanin in stress-induced behavior. We used foot shock, optogenetics, and behavioral pharmacology in wild-type (WT) mice and mice lacking either NE (Dbh(-/-)) or galanin (Gal(cKO-Dbh)) specifically in noradrenergic neurons to isolate the roles of these co-transmitters in regulating anxiety-like behavior in the elevated zero maze (EZM) either immediately or 24 h following stress. Foot shock and optogenetic LC stimulation produced immediate anxiety-like behavior in WT mice, and the effects of foot shock persisted for 24 h. NE-deficient mice were resistant to the anxiogenic effects of acute stress and optogenetic LC stimulation, while mice lacking noradrenergic-derived galanin displayed typical increases in anxiety-like behavior. However, when tested 24 h after foot shock, both Dbh(-/-) and Gal(cKO-Dbh) mice lacked normal expression of anxiety-like behavior. Pharmacological rescue of NE, but not galanin, in knockout mice during EZM testing was anxiogenic. In contrast, restoring galanin, but not NE, signaling during foot shock normalized stress-induced anxiety-like behavior 24 h later. These results indicate that NE and noradrenergic-derived galanin play complementary, but distinguishable roles in behavioral responses to stress. NE is required for the expression of acute stress-induced anxiety, while noradrenergic-derived galanin mediates the development of more persistent responses following a stressor.",JUL,2021,46,8,1535,1543,,10.1038/s41386-021-01011-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41386-021-01011-8,APR 2021,33911187,WOS:000645177900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Data Sources/Study Setting SEER-Medicare. Study Design We compared trends in the use of IMRT between patients treated in practices directly affected by fee reductions (for prostate cancer, men treated in urology practices that own IMRT equipment; for breast cancer, women treated in freestanding radiotherapy clinics) and patients treated in other types of practices. Data Collection/Extraction Methods We identified breast and prostate cancer patients receiving IMRT using outpatient and physician office claims. We classified urology practices based on whether they billed for IMRT and radiotherapy clinics based on whether they were reimbursed under the Physician Fee Schedule. Principal Findings Between 2006 and 2015 the payment for IMRT delivered in freestanding clinics and physician offices declined by $367 (-54.7%). However, the use of IMRT increased in physician practices subject to payment cuts, both in absolute terms and relative to use in practices unaffected by the payment cut. Use of IMRT in prostate cancer patients treated at urology practices that own IMRT equipment increased by 9.1 (95% CI: 2.0-16.2) percentage points between 2005 and 2016 relative to use in patients treated at other urology practices.

Our group and others have suggested that Nek2 maintains high levels of CA/CIN, tumor growth, and drug resistance. We identified that Nek2 overexpression correlates with poor survival of breast cancer. However, the mechanisms driving these phenotypes are unknown. We now report that overexpression of Nek2 in MCF10A cells drives CA/CIN and aneuploidy. Besides, enhanced levels of Nek2 results in larger 3D acinar structures, but could not initiate tumors in a p53(+/+) or a p53(-/-) xenograft model. Nek2 overexpression induced the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) while its downregulation reduced the expression of the mesenchymal marker vimentin.

Methods In this pivotal, randomised, triple-blind, sham-controlled trial, done in 19 stroke rehabilitation services in the UK and the USA, participants with moderate-to-severe arm weakness, at least 9 months after ischaemic stroke, were randomly assigned (1: 1) to either rehabilitation paired with active vagus nerve stimulation (VNS group) or rehabilitation paired with sham stimulation (control group). Randomisation was done by ResearchPoint Global (Austin, TX, USA) using SAS PROC PLAN (SAS Institute Software, Cary, NC, USA), with stratification by region (USA vs UK), age (<= 30 years vs >30 years), and baseline Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) score (20-35 vs 36-50). Participants, outcomes assessors, and treating therapists were masked to group assignment. All participants were implanted with a vagus nerve stimulation device.

One promising avenue of antimicrobial research that deserves renewed examination involves the use of peptides. Although antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been studied for a number of years, innovations in peptide design and their applications are increasingly making this approach a viable alternative to traditional small-molecule antibiotics. This review will provide updates on two ways in which peptides are being explored as antibiotics. The first topic will focus on novel types of peptides and conjugation methods that are being exploited to act as antibiotics themselves. These direct-acting modified peptides could serve as potentially useful drugs while mitigating many of the known liabilities of AMPs. The second topic relates to the use of peptides as delivery vehicles for other active compounds with antimicrobial activity. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are peptides designed to carry compounds across cell membranes and are a promising method for delivering a variety of antimicrobial compounds. When conjugated to other compounds, CPPs have been shown to be effective at increasing the uptake of both small- and large-molecular-weight compounds. This includes conjugation to antisense molecules and traditional antibiotics, resulting in increased effectiveness of these antimicrobials. One particular approach utilizes CPPs conjugated to phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs). PMOs are designed to target particular pathogens in a gene-specific way. They target mRNA and block protein translation. Peptide-conjugated PMOs (PPMOs) allow for efficient delivery into the Gram-negative cytoplasm, and recent updates to their in vitro and in vivo activity are reviewed. This includes recent data to suggest that PPMOs maintain activity in the setting of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) strains, an important finding as it relates to the further development of this therapeutic approach. Other topics include the ability to have activity in the biofilm setting, a finding that likely relates to the peptide portion of the conjugate. Finally, what is known and anticipated related to the development of resistance to these peptides will be discussed.",MAY 18,2021,54,10,2377,2385,,10.1021/acs.accounts.1c00040,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.accounts.1c00040,APR 2021,33881843,WOS:000654284300005,View Full Record in Web of Science

We examined whether time spent grooming with others in a highly social mammal species was associated with infection status for gastrointestinal parasites. Of six parasites detected, one (Trichuris sp.) was associated with social grooming behaviors, but more specifically with direct physical contact with others. Individuals infected with Trichuris sp. spent significantly less time grooming conspecifics than those not infected, and time in direct contact with others was the major predictor of infection status. One model correctly predicted infection status for Trichuris sp. with a reliability of 95.17% overall when the variables used were time spent in direct contact and time spent grooming others. This decrease in time spent grooming and interacting with others is likely a sickness behavior displayed by individuals with less energy or motivation for non-essential behaviors.

Measurements: Responses to five open-ended questions about CF PC-delivery, health care provider training, and lung transplant-underwent content analysis. Responses were coded using NVivo12 Software (TM). Results: Forty-eight CF adults, 59 caregivers, and 229 providers responded to the open-ended survey questions. Analysis showed 5 primary categories related to CF PC: (1) stakeholder perceptions of PC for CF, (2) delivering PC to people with CF, (3) conversations about PC for CF, (4) perceptions that PC services are underutilized for people with CF, and (5) beliefs that PC services are critical for people with CF considering or pursuing lung transplant. Analysis showed variation among and within groups in defining PC for CF, when, and how to deliver it. Many respondents felt PC was underutilized in CF. Most saw PC as particularly important when considering lung transplant, managing anxiety around transplant, and for goals of care discussions.

FindingsIn this randomized clinical trial that included 388 children and adults with sickle cell disease, treatment with poloxamer 188 vs placebo resulted in mean time to last dose of parenteral opioids during vaso-occlusive episodes of 81.8 vs 77.8 hours, a difference that was not statistically significant. MeaningAmong patients with sickle cell disease, poloxamer 188 did not significantly shorten the duration of painful vaso-occlusive episodes. ImportanceAlthough effective agents are available to prevent painful vaso-occlusive episodes of sickle cell disease (SCD), there are no disease-modifying therapies for ongoing painful vaso-occlusive episodes; treatment remains supportive. A previous phase 3 trial of poloxamer 188 reported shortened duration of painful vaso-occlusive episodes in SCD, particularly in children and participants treated with hydroxyurea. ObjectiveTo reassess the efficacy of poloxamer 188 for vaso-occlusive episodes. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsPhase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, international trial conducted from May 2013 to February 2016 that included 66 hospitals in 12 countries and 60 cities; 388 individuals with SCD (hemoglobin SS, SC, S-beta(0) thalassemia, or S-beta(+) thalassemia disease) aged 4 to 65 years with acute moderate to severe pain typical of painful vaso-occlusive episodes requiring hospitalization were included. InterventionsA 1-hour 100-mg/kg loading dose of poloxamer 188 intravenously followed by a 12-hour to 48-hour 30-mg/kg/h continuous infusion (n=194) or placebo (n=194). Main Outcomes and MeasuresTime in hours from randomization to the last dose of parenteral opioids among all participants and among those younger than 16 years as a separate subgroup. ResultsOf 437 participants assessed for eligibility, 388 were randomized (mean age, 15.2 years; 176 [45.4%] female), the primary outcome was available for 384 (99.0%), 15-day follow-up contacts were available for 357 (92.0%), and 30-day follow-up contacts were available for 368 (94.8%). There was no significant difference between the groups for the mean time to last dose of parenteral opioids (81.8 h for the poloxamer 188 group vs 77.8 h for the placebo group; difference, 4.0 h [95% CI, -7.8 to 15.7]; geometric mean ratio, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0-1.5]; P=.09). Based on a significant interaction of age and treatment (P=.01), there was a treatment difference in time from randomization to last administration of parenteral opioids for participants younger than 16 years (88.7 h in the poloxamer 188 group vs 71.9 h in the placebo group; difference, 16.8 h [95% CI, 1.7-32.0]; geometric mean ratio, 1.4 [95% CI, 1.1-1.8]; P=.008). Adverse events that were more common in the poloxamer 188 group than the placebo group included hyperbilirubinemia (12.7% vs 5.2%); those more common in the placebo group included hypoxia (12.0% vs 5.3%). Conclusions and RelevanceAmong children and adults with SCD, poloxamer 188 did not significantly shorten time to last dose of parenteral opioids during vaso-occlusive episodes. These findings do not support the use of poloxamer 188 for vaso-occlusive episodes.

The Rwanda National Guidelines for sexually transmitted infection (STI) syndromic management are not yet informed by the local prevalence and correlates of STI etiologies, a component World Health Organization guidelines stress as critical to optimize locally relevant algorithms. Methods Radio announcements and pharmacists recruited symptomatic patients to seek free STI services in Kigali. Clients who sought services were asked to refer sexual partners and symptomatic friends. Demographic, behavioral risk factor, medical history, and symptom data were collected. Genital exams were performed by trained research nurses and physicians. We conducted phlebotomy for rapid HIV and rapid plasma reagin (RPR) serologies and vaginal pool swab for microscopy of wet preparation to diagnose Trichomonas vaginalis (TV), bacterial vaginosis (BV), and vaginal Candida albicans (VCA). GeneXpert testing for Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) were conducted. Here we assess factors associated with diagnosis of NG and CT in men and women. We also explore factors associated with TV, BV and VCA in women. Finally, we describe genital ulcer and RPR results by HIV status, gender, and circumcision in men. Results Among 974 men (with 1013 visits), 20% were positive for CT and 74% were positive for NG. Among 569 women (with 579 visits), 17% were positive for CT and 27% were positive for NG. In multivariate analyses, factors associated with CT in men included younger age, responding to radio advertisements, <17 days since suspected exposure, and not having dysuria. Factors associated with NG in men included not having higher education or full-time employment, <17 days since suspected exposure, not reporting a genital ulcer, and having urethral discharge on physical exam. Factors associated with CT in women included younger age and < = 10 days with symptoms. Factors associated with NG in women included younger age, lower education and lack of full-time employment, sometimes using condoms vs. never, using hormonal vs. non-hormonal contraception, not having genital ulcer or itching, having symptoms < = 10 days, HIV+ status, having BV, endocervical discharge noted on speculum exam, and negative vaginal wet mount for VCA. In multivariate analyses, only reporting >1 partner was associated with BV; being single and RPR+ was associated with TV; and having < = 1 partner in the last month, being pregnant, genital itching, discharge, and being HIV and RPR negative were associated with VCA. Genital ulcers and positive RPR were associated with being HIV+ and lack of circumcision among men. HIV+ women were more likely to be RPR+. In HIV+ men and women, ulcers were more likely to be herpetic rather than syphilitic compared with their HIV- counterparts. Conclusions Syndromic management guidelines in Rwanda can be improved with consideration of the prevalence of confirmed infections from this study of symptomatic men and women representative of those who would seek care at government health centers.

All 12 lines had the characteristics of pluripotent stem cells, as assessed by immunostaining for pluripotency markers, expression of pluripotency genes, and differentiation into the 3 primary germ cell layers. Gene expression profiling with RNAseq demonstrated significant heterogeneity among the lines. Despite this heterogeneity, several anticipated abnormalities were readily detectable across all LND lines, including reduced HPRT1 mRNA. Several unexpected abnormalities were also consistently detectable across the LND lines, including decreases in FAR2P1 and increases in RNF39. Shotgun proteomics also demonstrated several expected abnormalities in the LND lines, such as absence of HGprt protein. The proteomics study also revealed several unexpected abnormalities across the LND lines, including increases in GNAO1 decreases in NSE4A. There was a good but partial correlation between abnormalities revealed by the RNAseq and proteomics methods. Finally, functional studies demonstrated LND lines had no HGprt enzyme activity and resistance to the toxic pro-drug 6-thioguanine.

Most understanding of the neurobiology underlying these dimensions comes from studies of cortical and limbic brain regions. While thalamic and subthalamic regions have been implicated in modulating fear, the potential for incerto-thalamic pathways to suppress fear generalization and rescue deficits in extinction recall remains unexplored. We first used patch-clamp electrophysiology to examine functional connections between the subthalamic zona incerta and thalamic reuniens (RE). Optogenetic stimulation of GABAergic ZI -> RE cell terminals in vitro induced inhibitory post-synaptic currents (IPSCs) in the RE. We then combined high-intensity discriminative auditory fear conditioning with cell-type-specific and projection-specific optogenetics in mice to assess functional roles of GABAergic ZI -> RE cell projections in modulating fear generalization and extinction recall. In addition, we used a similar approach to test the possibility of fear generalization and extinction recall being modulated by a smaller subset of GABAergic ZI -> RE cells, the A13 dopaminergic cell population. Optogenetic stimulation of GABAergic ZI -> RE cell terminals attenuated fear generalization and enhanced extinction recall. In contrast, optogenetic stimulation of dopaminergic ZI -> RE cell terminals had no effect on fear generalization but enhanced extinction recall in a dopamine receptor D1-dependent manner. Our findings shed new light on the neuroanatomy and neurochemistry of ZI-located cells that contribute to adaptive fear by increasing the precision and extinction of learned associations. In so doing, these data reveal novel neuroanatomical substrates that could be therapeutically targeted for treatment of PTSD.",AUG,2021,46,9,1658,1668,,10.1038/s41386-021-01006-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41386-021-01006-5,APR 2021,33864008,WOS:000640764200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study aimed to map EPIC tool to EuroQoL-5D-3L (EQ5D) to generate EQ5D health utilities. Methods and materials This is a secondary analysis of a prospective, randomized non-inferiority clinical trial, conducted between 04/2006 and 12/2009 at cancer centers across the United States, Canada, and Switzerland. Eligible patients included men >18 years with a known diagnosis of low-risk PC. Patient HRQoL data were collected using EPIC and health utilities were obtained using EQ5D. Data were divided into an estimation sample (n = 765, 70%) and a validation sample (n = 327, 30%). The mapping algorithms that capture the relationship between the instruments were estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS), Tobit, and two-part models. Five-fold cross-validation (in-sample) was used to compare the predictive performance of the estimated models. Final models were selected based on root mean square error (RMSE). Results A total of 565 patients in the estimation sample had complete information on both EPIC and EQ5D questionnaires at baseline. Mean observed EQ5D utility was 0.90 +/- 0.13 (range: 0.28-1) with 55% of patients in full health. OLS models outperformed their counterpart Tobit and two-part models for all pre-determined model specifications. The best model fit was: EQ5D utility = 0.248541 + 0.000748*(Urinary Function) + 0.001134*(Urinary Bother) + 0.000968*(Hormonal Function) + 0.004404*(Hormonal Bother)- 0.376487*(Zubrod) + 0.003562*(Urinary Function*Zubrod); RMSE was 0.10462.

However, reversion of BRCA mutation and restoration of HR repair in EOC lead to PARP inhibitor resistance and reduced clinical efficacy of PARP inhibitors. We have previously shown that triapine, a small molecule inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), impaired HR repair and sensitized HR repair-proficient EOC to PARP inhibitors. In this study, we performed in silico screening of small molecule libraries to identify novel compounds that bind to the triapine-binding pocket on the R2 subunit of RNR and inhibit RNR in EOC cells. Following experimental validation of selected top-ranking in silico hits for inhibition of dNTP and DNA synthesis, we identified, DB4, a putative RNR pocket-binding inhibitor markedly abrogated HR repair and sensitized BRCA-wild-type EOC cells to the PARP inhibitor olaparib. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the combination of DB4 and olaparib deterred the progression of BRCA-wild type EOC xenografts and significantly prolonged the survival time of tumor-bearing mice.

About 50-60% of those bacteria have the ability to produce resilient spores that are important for the life cycle in the gut and for host-to-host transmission. A genomic signature for sporulation in the human intestine was recently described, which spans both commensals and pathogens such as Clostridioides difficile and contains several genes of unknown function. We report on the characterization of a signature gene, CD25890, which, as we show is involved in the control of sporulation initiation in C. difficile under certain nutritional conditions. Spo0A is the main regulatory protein controlling entry into sporulation and we show that an in-frame deletion of CD25890 results in increased expression of spo0A per cell and increased sporulation. The effect of CD25890 on spo0A is likely indirect and mediated through repression of the sinRR ' operon.

Decisions at the policy level remain the entry point for maternal immunization programs. We describe the policy and decision-making process in Kenya for the introduction of new vaccines, with particular emphasis on maternal vaccines, and identify opportunities to improve vaccine policy formulation and implementation process. Methods We conducted 29 formal interviews with government officials and policy makers, including high-level officials at the Kenya National Immunization Technical Advisory Group, and Ministry of Health officials at national and county levels. All interviews were recorded and transcribed. We analyzed the qualitative data using NVivo 11.0 software. Results All key informants understood the vaccine policy formulation and implementation processes, although national officials appeared more informed compared to county officials. County officials reported feeling left out of policy development. The recent health system decentralization had both positive and negative impacts on the policy process; however, the negative impacts outweighed the positive impacts. Other factors outside vaccine policy environment such as rumours, sociocultural practices, and anti-vaccine campaigns influenced the policy development and implementation process.

Design, Setting, and Participants Cross-sectional, 1-day point-prevalence surveys of antimicrobial use performed between April 2017 and October 2017, last survey date October 31, 2017, and including 15 276 residents present on the survey date in 161 randomly selected nursing homes from selected counties of 10 Emerging Infections Program (EIP) states. EIP staff reviewed nursing home records to collect data on characteristics of residents and antimicrobials administered at the time of the survey. Nursing home characteristics were obtained from nursing home staff and the Nursing Home Compare website. Exposures Residence in one of the participating nursing homes at the time of the survey. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of antimicrobial use per 100 residents, defined as the number of residents receiving antimicrobial drugs at the time of the survey divided by the total number of surveyed residents. Multivariable logistic regression modeling of antimicrobial use and percentages of drugs within various classifications. Results Among 15 276 nursing home residents included in the study (mean [SD] age, 77.6 [13.7] years; 9475 [62%] women), complete prevalence data were available for 96.8%. The overall antimicrobial use prevalence was 8.2 per 100 residents (95% CI, 7.8-8.8). Antimicrobial use was more prevalent in residents admitted to the nursing home within 30 days before the survey date (18.8 per 100 residents; 95% CI, 17.4-20.3), with central venous catheters (62.8 per 100 residents; 95% CI, 56.9-68.3) or with indwelling urinary catheters (19.1 per 100 residents; 95% CI, 16.4-22.0). Antimicrobials were most often used to treat active infections (77% [95% CI, 74.8%-79.2%]) and primarily for urinary tract infections (28.1% [95% CI, 15.5%-30.7%]). While 18.2% (95% CI, 16.1%-20.1%) were for medical prophylaxis, most often use was for the urinary tract (40.8% [95% CI, 34.8%-47.1%]). Fluoroquinolones were the most common antimicrobial class (12.9% [95% CI, 11.3%-14.8%]), and 33.1% (95% CI, 30.7%-35.6%) of antimicrobials used were broad-spectrum antibiotics. Conclusions and Relevance In this cross-sectional survey of a cohort of US nursing homes in 2017, prevalence of antimicrobial use was 8.2 per 100 residents. This study provides information on the patterns of antimicrobial use among these nursing home residents.",APR 6,2021,325,13,1286,1295,,10.1001/jama.2021.2900,http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.2021.2900,,33821897,WOS:000638289800018,View Full Record in Web of Science

Minimal residual disease (MRD) is a sensitive measure of disease control. Sustained MRD negativity and outcomes were evaluated in these studies. METHODS MRD was assessed via next-generation sequencing (10(-5)) at suspected complete response (CR), 3 and 6 months following confirmed CR (POLLUX), 6 and 12 months following the first dose (CASTOR), and every 12 months post-CR in both studies. Sustained MRD negativity (>= 6 or >= 12 months) was evaluated in the intention-to-treat (ITT) and >= CR populations. RESULTS The median follow-up was 54.8 months in POLLUX and 50.2 months in CASTOR. In the ITT population, MRD-negativity rates were 32.5% versus 6.7% for D-Rd versus lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd) and 15.1% versus 1.6% for D-Vd versus bortezomib and dexamethasone (Vd; both P < .0001).

T835M mutation in netrin receptor UNC5C predisposes to the late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and increases neuronal cell death. However, it remains unclear how this receptor is molecularly regulated in AD. Here, we show that delta-secretase selectively cleaves UNC5C and escalates its proapoptotic activity, facilitating neurodegeneration in AD. Netrin deficiency activates delta-secretase that specifically cuts UNC5C at N467 and N547 residues and enhances subsequent caspase-3 activation, additively augmenting neuronal cell death. Blockade of delta-secretase cleavage of UNC5C diminishes T835M mutant's proapoptotic activity. Viral expression of delta-secretase-truncated UNC5C fragments into APP/PS1 mice strongly accelerates AD pathologies, impairing learning and memory. Conversely, deletion of UNC5C from netrin-1-depleted mice attenuates AD pathologies and rescues cognitive disorders.

Defective viral genomes (DVGs) can suppress virus replication by competing for viral proteins and by stimulating antiviral immunity. We studied the association between detection of DVGs of the copy-back type and disease severity in three RSV A-confirmed cohorts. In hospitalized children, detection of DVGs in respiratory samples at or around the time of admission associated strongly with more severe disease, higher viral load and a stronger pro-inflammatory response. Interestingly, in experimentally infected adults, the presence of DVGs in respiratory secretions differentially associated with RSV disease severity depending on when DVGs were detected. Detection of DVGs early after infection associated with low viral loads and mild disease, whereas detection of DVGs late after infection, especially if DVGs were present for prolonged periods, associated with high viral loads and severe disease. Taken together, we demonstrate that the kinetics of DVG accumulation and duration could predict clinical outcome of RSV A infection in humans, and thus could be used as a prognostic tool to identify patients at risk of worse clinical disease.

Population-based studies from Sweden and US SEER data have shown long-term survival rates of 62% and 65.7%, with the lower rate being from a higher percentage of early deaths. METHODS: In this prospective, multicenter trial, we developed a simplified algorithm that focused on prevention and early treatment of the three main causes of death: bleeding, differentiation syndrome, and infection. All patients with a diagnosis of APL were included. The initial 6 months were spent educating oncologists about early deaths in APL. At the time of suspicion of an APL, an expert was contacted. The algorithm was made available followed by discussion of the treatment plan. Communication between expert and treating physician was frequent in the first 2 weeks, during which time most deaths take place. RESULTS: Between September 2013 and April 2016, 120 patients enrolled in the study from 32 hospitals.

We developed and validated a novel prognostic index specific for BL to aid risk stratification, interpretation of clinical trials, and targeted development of novel treatment approaches. METHODS We derived the BL International Prognostic Index (BL-IPI) from a real-world data set of adult patients with BL treated with immunochemotherapy in the United States between 2009 and 2018, identifying candidate variables that showed the strongest prognostic association with progression-free survival (PFS). The index was validated in an external data set of patients treated in Europe, Canada, and Australia between 2004 and 2019. RESULTS In the derivation cohort of 633 patients with BL, age >= 40 years, performance status >= 2, serum lactate dehydrogenase > 3x upper limit of normal, and CNS involvement were selected as equally weighted factors with an independent prognostic value. The resulting BL-IPI identified groups with low (zero risk factors, 18% of patients), intermediate (one factor, 36% of patients), and high risk (>= 2 factors, 46% of patients) with 3-year PFS estimates of 92%, 72%, and 53%, respectively, and 3-year overall survival estimates of 96%, 76%, and 59%, respectively. The index discriminated outcomes regardless of HIV status, stage, or first-line chemotherapy regimen.

Guidelines on the use of illness severity scores to inform triage decisions for allocation of scarce resources, such as mechanical ventilation, during the current COVID-19 pandemic warrant examination for possible bias in these models. We investigated the performance of the severity scoring systems Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation IVa (APACHE IVa), Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS), and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) across four ethnicities in two large ICU databases to identify possible ethnicity-based bias. Methods Data from the electronic ICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database, built from patient episodes in the USA from 2014-15 and 2001-12, respectively, were analysed for score performance in Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White people after appropriate exclusions. Hospital mortality was the outcome of interest. Discrimination and calibration were determined for all three scoring systems in all four groups, using area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve for different ethnicities to assess discrimination, and standardised mortality ratio (SMR) or proxy measures to assess calibration. Findings We analysed 166751 participants (122919 eICU-CRD and 43 832 MIMIC-III). Although measurements of discrimination were significantly different among the groups (AUROC ranging from 0.86 to 0.89 [p=0.016] with APACHE IVa and from 0.75 to 0.77 [p=0.85] with OASIS), they did not display any discernible systematic patterns of bias. However, measurements of calibration indicated persistent, and in some cases statistically significant, patterns of difference between Hispanic people (SMR 0.73 with APACHE IVa and 0.64 with OASIS) and Black people (0.67 and 0.68) versus Asian people (0.77 and 0.95) and White people (0.76 and 0.81). Although calibrations were imperfect for all groups, the scores consistently showed a pattern of overpredicting mortality for Black people and Hispanic people. Similar results were seen using SOFA scores across the two databases. Interpretation The systematic differences in calibration across ethnicities suggest that illness severity scores reflect statistical bias in their predictions of mortality.

The impacts of criminal justice reform and increasing drug treatment access on HIV have been underexplored. Methods: We developed agent-based models (ABM) of sexual partnerships among PWID and non-PWID, and injection equipment-sharing partnerships among PWID in five US cities (Baltimore, Boston, Miami, New York City, San Francisco) over 3 years. The first set of ABM projected changes in partnership discordance among PWID as a function of decreasing ZIP code-level incarceration rates. The second set projected discordance as a function of increasing ZIP code-level drug treatment access. ABM were parameterized and validated overall, and by city and PWID race/ethnicity (Black, Latino, White) using National HIV Behavioral Surveillance data, administrative ZIP code-level data, surveillance reports and prior literature. Informed by research on prisoner release and community-level HIV prevalence, reductions in incarceration rates were fixed at 5% and 30% and respectively projected to increase ZIP code-level HIV prevalence by 2% and 12%. Increases in drug treatment access were fixed at 30% and 58%. Results: In each city, a 30% reduction in ZIP code-level incarceration rates and 12% increase in ZIP code-level HIV prevalence significantly increased sero-discordance among at least one racial/ethnic group of PWID by 1-3 percentage points. A 5% reduction in incarceration rates, and 30% and 58% increases in drug treatment access, led to isolated significant changes in sero-discordance among Black and White PWID that were less than 1 percentage point. Conclusion: Reductions in incarceration rates may lead to short-term increases in sero-discordant partnerships among some PWID by increasing community-level HIV prevalence. Efforts to increase HIV testing, engagement in care and community reintegration post release, should be strengthened in the wake of incarceration reform. Additional research should confirm these findings and explore the lack of widespread impacts of drug treatment in this study.",AUG,2021,94,,,,103194,10.1016/j.drugpo.2021.103194,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2021.103194,MAR 2021,33812133,WOS:000685125000015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory intestinal disease that is frequently accompanied by aberrant healing and stricturing complications. Crosstalk between activated myeloid and stromal cells is critical in the pathogenicity of Crohn's disease(1,2), and increases in intravasating monocytes are correlated with a lack of response to anti-TNF treatment(3). The risk alleles with the highest effect on Crohn's disease are loss-of-function mutations in NOD2(4,5), which increase the risk of stricturing(6). However, the mechanisms that underlie pathogenicity driven by NOD2 mutations and the pathways that might rescue a lack of response to anti-TNF treatment remain largely uncharacterized. Here we use direct ex vivo analyses of patients who carry risk alleles of NOD2 to show that loss of NOD2 leads to dysregulated homeostasis of activated fibroblasts and macrophages. CD14(+) peripheral blood mononuclear cells from carriers of NOD2 risk alleles produce cells that express high levels of collagen, and elevation of conserved signatures is observed in nod2-deficient zebrafish models of intestinal injury. The enrichment of STAT3 regulation and gp130 ligands in activated fibroblasts and macrophages suggested that gp130 blockade might rescue the activated program in NOD2-deficient cells. We show that post-treatment induction of the STAT3 pathway is correlated with a lack of response to anti-TNF treatment in patients, and demonstrate in vivo in zebrafish the amelioration of the activated myeloid-stromal niche using the specific gp130 inhibitor bazedoxifene. Our results provide insights into NOD2-driven fibrosis in Crohn's disease, and suggest that gp130 blockade may benefit some patients with Crohn's disease-potentially as a complement to anti-TNF therapy.",MAY 13,2021,593,7858,275,+,,10.1038/s41586-021-03484-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03484-5,MAR 2021,33789339,WOS:000642031500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Such differences between humans and other primates are thought to be a result, at least in part, of interspecies differences in immune response to infection. However, because of the lack of comparative functional data across species, it remains unclear in what ways the immune systems of humans and other primates differ. Here, we report the whole-genome transcriptomic responses of ape species (human and chimpanzee) and AAMs (rhesus macaque and baboon) to bacterial and viral stimulation. We find stark differences in the responsiveness of these groups, with apes mounting a markedly stronger early transcriptional response to both viral and bacterial stimulation, altering the transcription of similar to 40% more genes than AAMs. Additionally, we find that genes involved in the regulation of inflammatory and interferon responses show the most divergent early transcriptional responses across primates and that this divergence is attenuated over time. Finally, we find that relative to AAMs, apes engage a much less specific immune response to different classes of pathogens during the early hours of infection, up-regulating genes typical of antiviral and anti-bacterial responses regardless of the nature of the stimulus. Overall, these findings suggest apes exhibit increased sensitivity to bacterial and viral immune stimulation, activating a broader array of defense molecules that may be beneficial for early pathogen killing at the potential cost of increased energy expenditure and tissue damage.",MAR 30,2021,118,13,,,e2015855118,10.1073/pnas.2015855118,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2015855118,,33771921,WOS:000637394200022,View Full Record in Web of Science

These Tregs are specifically adapted to function and operate in their home tissue-When, where, and how do they take on their specialized characteristics? We recently reported that a splenic Treg population expressing low levels of the transcription factor PPAR gamma (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) contains precursors of Tregs residing in visceral adipose tissue. This finding made sense given that PPAR gamma, the master regulator of adipocyte differentiation, is required for the accumulation and function of Tregs in visceral adipose tissue but not in lymphoid tissues. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell Tcra and Tcrb sequencing, and adoptive-transfer experiments to show that, unexpectedly, the splenic PPAR gamma(lo) Treg population is transcriptionally heterogeneous and engenders Tregs in multiple nonlymphoid tissues beyond visceral adipose tissue, such as skin and liver.

A canarypox-protein HIV vaccine regimen (ALVAC-HIV plus AIDSVAX B/E) showed modest efficacy in reducing infection in Thailand. An analogous regimen using HIV-1 subtype C virus showed potent humoral and cellular responses in a phase 1-2a trial in South Africa. Efficacy data and additional safety data were needed for this regimen in a larger population in South Africa. METHODS In this phase 2b-3 trial, we randomly assigned 5404 adults without HIV-1 infection to receive the vaccine (2704 participants) or placebo (2700 participants). The vaccine regimen consisted of injections of ALVAC-HIV at months 0 and 1, followed by four booster injections of ALVAC-HIV plus bivalent subtype C gp120-MF59 adjuvant at months 3, 6, 12, and 18. The primary efficacy outcome was the occurrence of HIV-1 infection from randomization to 24 months. RESULTS In January 2020, prespecified criteria for nonefficacy were met at an interim analysis; further vaccinations were subsequently halted. The median age of the trial participants was 24 years; 70% of the participants were women. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the vaccine and placebo groups.

While the rs71947865 association did not replicate in the entire follow-up sample of 171 KLS cases, rs71947865 was significantly associated with KLS in the subset follow-up sample of 59 KLS cases who reported birth difficulties (OR = 1.54, P = 0.01). Genetic liability of KLS as explained by polygenic risk scores was increased (pseudo R-2 = 0.15; P < 2.0 x 10(-22) at P = 0.5 threshold) in the follow-up sample. Pathway analysis of genetic associations identified enrichment of circadian regulation pathway genes in KLS cases. Our results suggest links between KLS, circadian regulation, and bipolar disorder, and indicate that the TRANK1 polymorphisms in conjunction with reported birth difficulties may predispose to KLS.",MAR 23,2021,118,12,,,e2005753118,10.1073/pnas.2005753118,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2005753118,,33737391,WOS:000631868600003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Specific cost-saving functions of SPC remain unclear. Objectives: (1) To assess the effect of SPC on inpatient costs and length of stay (LOS) and (2) to evaluate differences in costs by indication and timing of SPC. Design: Case-control with in patients who received an SPC consultation and propensity matched controls. Setting: One large U.S. integrated delivery finance system. Measurements: Using administrative data, we assessed costs associated with inpatient stays, a subset of whom received an SPC consultation. Consultations were stratified by reasons based on physician discretion: goals of care, pain management, hospice evaluation, nonpain symptom management, or support. The primary outcome was total operating costs and the secondary outcome was hospital LOS. Results: In total, 1404 patients with SPC consultations associated with unique hospital encounters were matched with 2806 controls. Total operating costs were lower for patients who received an SPC consultation when the consultation was within 0 to 1 days of admission ($6,924 vs. $7,635, p = 0.002). Likewise, LOS was shorter (4.3 vs. 4.7 days, p < 0.001). Upon stratification by reason, goals-of-care consultations early in the hospital stay (days 0-1) were associated with reduced total operating costs ($7,205 vs. $8,677, p < 0.001). Costs were higher for pain management consultations ($7,727 vs. $6,914, p = 0.047). Consultation for hospice evaluation was associated with lower costs, particularly when early (hospital days 0-1: $4,125 vs. $7,415, p < 0.001).

Design A content analysis using tweets about heat illness + health. Methods Tweets were pulled from Twitter's application programming interface with premium access using Postman and the key words heat illness + health. All data cleaning and analysis was performed in R Version 3.5.2, and the tweet set was analyzed for term frequency, sentiment, and topic modeling. Principal R packages included LDAvis, tidytext, tm, and zyuzhet. Results 6,317 tweets were analyzed with a date range of April 6, 2009, to December 30, 2019. The most common terms in the tweets were heat (n = 4,532), illness (n = 4,085), and health (n = 2,257). Sentiment analysis showed that the majority of tweets (55%) had a negative sentiment. Topic modeling showed that there were three topics within the tweet set: increasing impact, prevention and safety, and symptoms. Conclusions Twitter can be a useful tool for nursing researchers, serving as a viable adjunct to current research methodologies. This practical example has facilitated a deeper understanding of the social media representation of heat illness and health that can be applied to other research. Clinical Relevance Twitter serves as a tool for collecting health information for multiple groups, ranging from clinicians and researchers to patients.

Exciting therapeutic targets are emerging from CRISPR-based screens of high mutational-burden adult cancers. A key question, however, is whether functional genomic approaches will yield new targets in pediatric cancers, known for remarkably few mutations, which often encode proteins considered challenging drug targets. To address this, we created a first-generation pediatric cancer dependency map representing 13 pediatric solid and brain tumor types. Eighty-two pediatric cancer cell lines were subjected to genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screening to identify genes required for cell survival. In contrast to the finding that pediatric cancers harbor fewer somatic mutations, we found a similar complexity of genetic dependencies in pediatric cancer cell lines compared to that in adult models. Findings from the pediatric cancer dependency map provide preclinical support for ongoing precision medicine clinical trials. The vulnerabilities observed in pediatric cancers were often distinct from those in adult cancer, indicating that repurposing adult oncology drugs will be insufficient to address childhood cancers.",APR,2021,53,4,529,+,,10.1038/s41588-021-00819-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41588-021-00819-w,MAR 2021,33753930,WOS:000631490100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods Hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-COV-2 from four Atlanta hospitals were included in this observational cohort study and underwent admission testing of MOCHA parameters (plasma d-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1.2, thrombin-antithrombin complex, fibrin monomer). Clinical outcomes included deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, access line thrombosis, ICU admission, intubation and mortality. Main results Of 276 patients (mean age 59 +/- 6.4 years, 47% female, 62% African American), 45 (16%) had a thrombotic endpoint. Each MOCHA parameter was independently associated with a thrombotic event (p<0.05) and >= 2 abnormalities was associated with thrombotic endpoints (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.2-8.8) as were admission D-dimer >= 2000 ng/mL (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.5-6.6) and >= 3000 ng/mL (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.6-7.9). However, only >= 2 MOCHA abnormalities were associated with ICU admission (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.7-5.2) and intubation (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.6-6.4). MOCHA and D-dimer cutoffs were not associated with mortality. MOCHA with <2 abnormalities (26% of the cohort) had 89% sensitivity and 93% negative predictive value for a thrombotic endpoint. Conclusions An admission MOCHA profile is useful to risk-stratify COVID-19 patients for thrombotic complications and more effective than isolated d-dimer for predicting risk of ICU admission and intubation.",MAR 19,2021,16,3,,,e0248230,10.1371/journal.pone.0248230,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248230,,33740793,WOS:000631030200016,View Full Record in Web of Science

The epidemic has been stubbornly persistent; high incidence densities have been sustained over decades and the epidemic is increasingly concentrated among racial, ethnic, and sexual and gender minority communities. This fact remains true despite extraordinary scientific advances in prevention, treatment, and care-advances that have been led, to a substantial degree, by US-supported science and researchers. In this watershed year of 2021 and in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is clear that the USA will not meet the stated goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, particularly those goals relating to reductions in new infections, decreases in morbidity, and reductions in HIV stigma. The six papers in the Lancet Series on HIV in the USA have each examined the underlying causes of these challenges and laid out paths forward for an invigorated, sustained, and more equitable response to the US HIV epidemic than has been seen to date. The sciences of HIV surveillance, prevention, treatment, and implementation all suggest that the visionary goals of the Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative in the USA might be achievable.

METHODS We enrolled at-risk cisgender men and transgender persons in the Americas and Europe in the HVTN 704/HPTN 085 trial and at-risk women in sub-Saharan Africa in the HVTN 703/HPTN 081 trial. Participants were randomly assigned to receive, every 8 weeks, infusions of a bnAb (VRC01) at a dose of either 10 or 30 mg per kilogram (low-dose group and high-dose group, respectively) or placebo, for 10 infusions in total. HIV-1 testing was performed every 4 weeks. The VRC01 80% inhibitory concentration (IC80) of acquired isolates was measured with the TZM-bl assay. RESULTS Adverse events were similar in number and severity among the treatment groups within each trial. Among the 2699 participants in HVTN 704/HPTN 085, HIV-1 infection occurred in 32 in the low-dose group, 28 in the high-dose group, and 38 in the placebo group. Among the 1924 participants in HVTN 703/HPTN 081, infection occurred in 28 in the low-dose group, 19 in the high-dose group, and 29 in the placebo group. The incidence of HIV-1 infection per 100 person-years in HVTN 704/HPTN 085 was 2.35 in the pooled VRC01 groups and 2.98 in the placebo group (estimated prevention efficacy, 26.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -11.7 to 51.8; P = 0.15), and the incidence per 100 person-years in HVTN 703/HPTN 081 was 2.49 in the pooled VRC01 groups and 3.10 in the placebo group (estimated prevention efficacy, 8.8%; 95% CI, -45.1 to 42.6; P = 0.70). In prespecified analyses pooling data across the trials, the incidence of infection with VRC01-sensitive isolates (IC80 <1 mu g per milliliter) per 100 person-years was 0.20 among VRC01 recipients and 0.86 among placebo recipients (estimated prevention efficacy, 75.4%; 95% CI, 45.5 to 88.9). The prevention efficacy against sensitive isolates was similar for each VRC01 dose and trial; VRC01 did not prevent acquisition of other HIV-1 isolates.
